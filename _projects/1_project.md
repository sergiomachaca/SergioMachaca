This multimodality haptic feedback wearable provides squeezing and vibrotactile cues to the user from a wrist-worn device.
In a user study I am currently running, we are evaluating if the multimodality haptic feedback can improve surgical training task performance for surgical residents using the da Vinci robot.
The flexible wristband design is inspired by Pezent et al. 2019.
