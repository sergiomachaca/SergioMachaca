      "summary": "Humans normally integrate multiple haptic signals during dexterous manipulation with the natural limb. Operating telerobots such as surgical robots and upper-limb prostheses removes this multimodality feedback. While considerable research has focused on single-modality haptic feedback and discrete multimodality haptic feedback, little is known regarding the utility of continuous multimodality feedback. Here, we present an experimental framework designed to explore continuous multimodality haptic feedback for dexterous manipulation. Participants performed a grasp-and-hold task in a virtual environment with either direct or myoelectric control under different haptic feedback conditions: no feedback, vibrotactile feedback of object slip, squeeze feedback of grip force, and combined vibrotactile and squeeze feedback. Results from preliminary pilot studies highlight the gap in knowledge surrounding the potential utility of continuous multimodality feedback in differing telerobot control scenarios."

      "releaseDate": "2018-05-24",
      "doi": "10.1039/C8SM00403J",
      "summary": "We report on the collective behavior of active particles in which energy is continuously supplied to rotational degrees of freedom. The active spinners are 3D-printed disks, 1 cm in diameter, that have an embedded fan-like structure, such that a sub-levitating up-flow of air forces them to spin. Single spinners exhibit Brownian motion with a narrow Gaussian velocity distribution function, P(v), for translational motion. We study the evolution of P(v) as the packing fraction and the average single particle spin speeds are varied. The interparticle hydrodynamic interaction is negligible, and the dynamics is dominated by hyperelastic collisions and dissipative forces. As expected for nonequilibrium systems, P(v) for a collection of many spinners deviates from Gaussian behavior. However, unlike translationally active systems, phase separation is not observed, and the system remains spatially homogeneous. We then search for a near-equilibrium counterpart for our active spinners by measuring the equation of state. Interestingly, it agrees well with a hard-sphere model, despite the dissipative nature of the single particle dynamics."
