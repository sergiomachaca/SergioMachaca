<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am a PhD student in the <a href='https://me.jhu.edu'>Department of Mechanical Engineering</a> at Johns Hopkins University and a graduate research assistant in the Haptics and Medical Robotics Laboratory (HAMR Lab) led by Dr. Jeremy Brown.

My research has been funded by the National Science Foundation <a href='https://www.nsfgrfp.org'>Graduate Research Fellowships Program (NSF GRFP)</a> and the Link Foundation <a href='https://linksim.org'>Modeling, Simulation, and Training (MS&T) Fellowship</a>.

During my undergraduate education at <a href='https://drexel.edu'>Drexel University</a>, I interned at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (Laurel, MD, USA) and Siemens AG (Munich, Germany), and I was a National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates (NSF REU) student at University of Pennsylvania Laboratory for Research on the Structure of Matter.
