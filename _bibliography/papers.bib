The aim of the study was to perform systematic review and meta-analysis on all the available data to evaluate the role of mental training in the acquisition of surgical technical skills. Methods The following search databases were used: EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov.UK, SIGN guidelines, NICE guidelines, and Cochrane review register. Meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.2 statistical software. Results There were a total of 9 randomized controlled trials with 474 participants, of which 189 participants received mental training. Five randomized controlled trials concluded positive impact of mental training. Mental training group did not show any significant improvement in overall performance of the task carried in each study (P =.06). Conclusion Mental training can be used as an important supplementary tool in learning surgical skills when run in parallel with physical training and applied to trainees with some experience of the skill.},

   abstract = {Conclusion Assessment of operative skills in the operating theater using this modified OSATS instrument has the potential to establish learning curves, allowing adequate monitoring of residents' progress in achieving operative competence. The Alphabetic Summary Scale seems to be of additional value. Use of the Overall Performance Scale should be reconsidered.
Background With the implementation of competency-based curricula, Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) increasingly is being used for the assessment of operative skills. Although evidence for its usefulness has been demonstrated in experimental study designs, data supporting OSATS application in the operating room are limited. This study evaluates the validity and reliability of the OSATS instrument to assess the operative skills of surgery residents in the operating theater.
Methods Twenty-four residents were recruited from seven hospitals within a general surgical training region and classified equally into three groups according to postgraduate training year (PGY). Each resident had to perform five different types of operations. Surgical performance was measured using a modified OSATS consisting of three scales: Global Rating Scale, Overall Performance Scale, and Alphabetic Summary Scale. Validity and reliability metrics included construct validity (Kruskal-Wallis test) and internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's α coefficient). Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated to determine correlations between the different scales.
Results Eighteen residents (PGY 1-2 [n = 7]; PGY 3-4 [n = 8]; PGY 5-6 [n = 3]) performed 249 operations. Comparisons of the performance scores revealed that evidence for construct validity depended on the difficulty level of the selected procedures. For individual operations, internal consistency reliability of the Global Rating Scale ranged from 0.93 to 0.95. Scores on the different scales correlated strongly (r = 0.62-0.76, P <.001).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past 20 years the surgical simulator market has seen substantial growth. Simulators are useful for teaching surgical skills effectively and with minimal harm and discomfort to patients. Before a simulator can be integrated into an educational program, it is recommended that its validity be determined. This study aims to provide a critical review of the literature and the main experiences and efforts relating to the validation of simulators during the last two decades. METHODS: Subjective and objective validity studies between 1980 and 2008 were identified by searches in Pubmed, Cochrane, and Web of Science. RESULTS: Although several papers have described definitions of various subjective types of validity, the literature does not offer any general guidelines concerning methods, settings, and data interpretation. Objective validation studies on endourological simulators were mainly characterized by a large variety of methods and parameters used to assess validity and in the definition and identification of expert and novice levels of performance. CONCLUSION: Validity research is hampered by a paucity of widely accepted definitions and measurement methods of validity. It would be helpful to those considering the use of simulators in training programs if there were consensus on guidelines for validating surgical simulators and the development of training programs. Before undertaking a study to validate a simulator, researchers would be well advised to conduct a training needs analysis (TNA) to evaluate the existing need for training and to determine program requirements in a training program design (TPD), methods that are also used by designers of military simulation programs. Development and validation of training models should be based on a multidisciplinary approach involving specialists (teachers), residents (learners), educationalists (teaching the teachers), and industrial designers (providers of teaching facilities). In addition to technical skills, attention should be paid to contextual, interpersonal, and task-related factors.},

The aim of this study was to identify observational tools for technical skill assessment, to assess characteristics of these tools, and to assess their usefulness for assessment. METHODS: Included studies reported tools for observational assessment of technical skills. A total of 106 articles were included. RESULTS: Three main categories included global assessment scales evaluating generic skills (n = 29), task-specific methods assessing procedure-specific skills (n = 30), and combinations of tools evaluating both generic and task-specific skills (n = 47). In most studies, content validity was not evaluated using an accepted scientific method. All tools were assessed for inter-rater reliability and construct validity. Data on feasibility, acceptability, and educational impact were sparse. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of validity and reliability for observational assessment tools at the trainee level. In most studies a comprehensive analysis of the tools was not achieved. Evaluation of technical skill using current observational assessment tools is not reliable and valid at the specialist level. Future research needs to focus on further systematic tool development and analysis, especially at the specialist level. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Objective To develop a teaching and assessment tool for laparoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knot tying. Design and Setting We designed an Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) tool that includes a procedure-specific checklist (PSC) and global rating scale (GRS) to assess laparoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knot-tying performance. Obstetrics and Gynecology residents at our institution were videotaped while performing a laparoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knot-tying task at a surgical simulation workshop. A total of 2 expert reviewers assessed resident performance using the OSATS tool during live performance and 1 month later using the videotaped recordings. OSATS scores were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Data are presented as median scores (interquartile range [IQR]). Intrarater and interrater reliabilities were assessed using a Spearman correlation and are presented as an r correlation coefficient and p value. An r ≥ 0.8 was considered as a high correlation. After testing, we received feedback from residents and faculty to improve the OSATS tool as part of an iterative design process. Participants In all, 14 of 21 residents (66.7%) completed the study, with 9 junior residents and 5 senior residents. Results Junior residents had a lower score on the PSC than senior residents did; however, this was not statistically significant (median = 6.0 [IQR: 4.0-10.0] and median = 13.0 [IQR: 10.0-13.0]; p = 0.09). There was excellent intrarater reliability with our OSATS tool (for PSC component, r = 0.88 for Rater 1 and 0.93 for Rater 2, both p < 0.0001; for GRS component, r = 0.85 for Rater 1 and 0.88 for Rater 2, both p ≤ 0.0002). The PSC also has high interrater reliability during live evaluation (r = 0.92; p < 0.0001), and during the videotape scoring with r = 0.77 (p = 0.001). Conclusions Our OSATS tool may be a useful assessment and teaching tool for laparoscopic suturing and intracorporeal knot-tying skills. Overall, good intrarater reliability was demonstrated, suggesting that this tool may be useful for longitudinal assessment of surgical skills.},

Objective data regarding the effectiveness of instruction or monitoring progress in simulating vascular and bowel anastomoses are lacking. The aim of this study is to provide subjective and objective assessments of simulation-based training among residents in hand-sewn vascular and bowel anastomoses. Methods Residents received vascular and bowel anastomoses training. Each resident fashioned anastomoses on both cadaveric saphenous veins and small bowel. The residents repeated the anastomoses 1 week later. Performances were assessed subjectively and objectively by questionnaire, operative time, objective structured assessment of technical skills (OSATS) score, and leak pressures of the finished anastomosis. Results Of 14 residents, 12 felt more confident with bowel anastomoses after the laboratory session, and 10 were more confident with vascular anastomoses. For vascular anastomoses, the operating time decreased (15.4 vs 14.2 minutes, p = 0.3), OSATS scores improved (14.9 vs 15.6, p = 0.15), and leak pressures improved (38.9 vs 71.8 psi, p = 0.001) from the first to the second workshop. For bowel anastomoses, the operating time decreased (23 vs 18 minutes, p < 0.001), OSATS scores improved (12.9 vs 14.4, p < 0.001), and leak pressures improved (17.7 vs 26.9 psi, p < 0.001).

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE Most trainees begin learning robotic minimally invasive surgery by performing inanimate practice tasks with clinical robots such as the Intuitive Surgical da Vinci. Expert surgeons are commonly asked to evaluate these performances using standardized five-point rating scales, but doing such ratings is time consuming, tedious, and somewhat subjective. This article presents an automatic skill evaluation system that analyzes only the contact force with the task materials, the broad-bandwidth accelerations of the robotic instruments and camera, and the task completion time. METHODS We recruited N=38 participants of varying skill in robotic surgery to perform three trials of peg transfer with a da Vinci Standard robot instrumented with our Smart Task Board. After calibration, three individuals rated these trials on five domains of the GEARS structured assessment tool, providing ground-truth labels for regression and classification machine learning algorithms that predict GEARS scores based on the recorded force, acceleration, and time signals. RESULTS Both machine learning approaches produced scores on the reserved testing sets that were in good to excellent agreement with the human raters, even when the force information was not considered. Furthermore, regression predicted GEARS scores more accurately and efficiently than classification. CONCLUSION A surgeon's skill at robotic peg transfer can be reliably rated via regression using features gathered from force, acceleration, and time sensors external to the robot. SIGNIFICANCE We expect improved trainee learning as a result of providing these automatic skill ratings during inanimate task practice on a surgical robot.},

Some advocate observation in the operating room, while others promote animal and simulated models or a combination of surgical related tasks. The mode of proficiency evaluation common to all of these methods has been subjective evaluation by a skilled surgeon. In order to define an objective means of evaluating performance, an instrumented laparoscopic grasper was developed measuring the force/torque at the surgeon hand/tool interface. The measured database demonstrated substantial differences between experienced and novice surgeon groups. Analyzing forces and torques combined with the state transition during surgical procedures allows an objective measurement of skill in MIS. Teaching the novice surgeon to limit excessive loads and improve movement efficiency during surgical procedures can potentially result in less injury to soft tissues and less wasted time during laparoscopic surgery. Moreover the force/torque database measured in this study may be used for developing realistic virtual reality simulators and optimization of medical robots performance.},

The study is then aimed to define the perceptual fidelity boundary oflaparoscopic pulling forces. This is approached with an experimental design in which surgeons assess the resistance against pulling of four dif- ferent tissues, which are characterized with both in vivo interaction forces and ex vivo tissue biomechanical properties. A logarithmic law of tissue consistency perception is found comparing subjective valorizations with objective parameters.Amodel ofthis perception is developed identifying what the main parameters are: the grade of fixation of the organ, the tissue stiffness, the amount of tissue bitten, and the organ mass being pulled. These results are a clear requirement analysis for the force feedback algorithm of a virtual reality laparoscopic simulator.

The purpose of this study was to show face, content, and construct validity of four, inanimate training exercises using the da Vinci (®) Si surgical system configured with Single-Site (™) instrumentation.\n\nMETHODS: New (N = 21) and experienced (N = 6) surgeons participated in the study. New surgeons (11 Gynecology [GYN] and 10 General Surgery [GEN]) had not completed any da Vinci Single-Site cases but may have completed multiport cases using the da Vinci system. They participated in this study prior to attending a certification course focused on da Vinci Single-Site instrumentation. Experienced surgeons (5 GYN and 1 GEN) had completed at least 25 da Vinci Single-Site cases. The surgeons completed four inanimate training exercises and then rated them with a questionnaire. Raw metrics and overall normalized scores were computed using both video recordings and kinematic data collected from the surgical system.\n\nRESULTS: The experienced surgeons significantly outperformed new surgeons for many raw metrics and the overall normalized scores derived from video review (p < 0.05). Only one exercise did not achieve a significant difference between new and experienced surgeons (p = 0.08) when calculating an overall normalized score using both video and advanced metrics derived from kinematic data. Both new and experienced surgeons rated the training exercises as appearing, to train and measure technical skills used during da Vinci Single-Site surgery and actually testing the technical skills used during da Vinci Single-Site surgery.\n\nCONCLUSIONS: In summary, the four training exercises showed face, content, and construct validity. Improved overall scores could be developed using additional metrics not included in this study. The results suggest that the training exercises could be used in an overall training curriculum aimed at developing proficiency in technical skills for surgeons new to da Vinci Single-Site instrumentation.},

In this paper we propose a serious gaming approach in order to facilitate the learning process. The novelty in our concept is that we decouple the game and the didactical content, which allows us to transfer the learning to the youngster's leisure time. In our research, we built a framework containing several (fun) games and an administration environment that facilitates the creation of learning content. In a user experiment, measuring the user's joy and motivationwe found that the subjects enjoyed playing the games and were very attentive when the didactical content appeared.},

The BlindAid allows users to interact with different virtual structures and objects via auditory and haptic feedback. This case study aims to examine if and how the BlindAid, in conjunction with a traditional rehabilitation programme, can help people who are newly blind develop new orientation and mobility methods. Follow-up research based on this study, with a large experiment and control group, could contribute to the area of orientation and mobility rehabilitation training for the newly blind. The case study research focused on A., a woman who is newly blind, for 17 virtual sessions spanning ten weeks, during the 12 weeks of her traditional orientation and mobility rehabilitation programme. The research was implemented by using virtual environment (VE) exploration and orientation tasks in VE and physical spaces. The research methodology used both qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, questionnaire, videotape recording, and user computer logs. The results of this study helped elucidate several issues concerning the contribution of the BlindAid system to the exploration strategies and learning processes experienced by the participant in her encounters with familiar and unfamiliar physical surroundings.

   abstract = {Two main problems to be solved in designing truly effective mobility aids for the blind are: 1) to determine what kinds and how many pieces of information are necessary and/or sufficient to mobilize humans, and 2) to establish the optimal coding and display method of the acquired information. If a robot is to be designed which can independently travel from one place to another, using a city map with specific landmarks stored in its memory and obstacle information gathered by the sensors on board the robot, these pieces of information acquired and used by the robot provide one solution to the first problem. In this paper, a guide dog robot (MELDOG) is described which approaches the first problem in this manner. MELDOG intends to enhance mobility aids for the blind by providing them with the functions of guide dogs, i.e., obedience in navigating its blind master, intelligent disobedience in detecting and avoiding obstacles in his/her path, and companionship in communicating between the master and the robot. For the second problem of displaying the information acquired, the electrocutaneous communication systems being developed, based on the fundamental experiments on electrocutaneous stimulation, are explained. These include constant pulse energy circuits which keep the perceived sensational magnitude constant despite the change of the skin impedance, and two-dimensional phantom sensations which reduce the number of the electrodes used.},

Recent trends in patient safety, simulation training, and technological advances have generated a need for accurate and objective assessment of surgical technical skills. This review is intended to identify the breadth and scope of recent approaches to surgical skill assessment and metrics and define gaps for further development. Recent findings Surgical skill assessment methods can be broadly categorized as (1) assessments by expert observations using validated task-specific checklists and global rating scales, (2) automated motion tracking metrics using mechanical force sensors, accelerometers or computer video analysis, and (3) mechanical outcome metrics.

   abstract = {Innovative procedures and technologies are regu-larly introduced into clinical practice. Although the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) exercises strict regulatory control over new drugs, it exerts minimal over-sight for new devices and no oversight for new surgical techniques. When technology such as the da Vinci robot enters the field of surgery, it is less clear who is respon-sible for ensuring its safe introduction. When implementing new technologies, physicians are guided by their sense of professionalism and the po-tential liability for medical malpractice; hospitals jointly share the medicolegal risks by confirming the qualifica-tions of licensed physicians (credentialing) and by autho-rizing those physicians for specific patient care services (privileging). In recent years, controversy has arisen when manufacturers go beyond their traditional role (ie, to rea-sonably design and manufacture a device) and partici-pate in training and credentialing physicians to use their company's product. This Viewpoint reviews an impor-tant legal ruling on robotic surgery that highlights poten-tial safety concerns regarding the regulation of novel pro-cedures and technologies as they enter clinical practice. In 2000, the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical) was initially approved by the FDA for use in gen-eral laparoscopic surgical procedures. Despite little evi-dence, robotic surgery was touted to have many ben-efits. Dissemination of this technology was rapid in its first decade as the FDA expanded its list of approved in-dications across general surgery, urology, gynecology, cardiothoracic surgery, pediatric surgery, and otolaryn-gology disciplines. The widespread adoption of robotic surgery has been partially attributed to aggressive mar-keting tactics, which increased demand for the technol-ogy from patients and invoked fascination among pa-tients, surgeons, and hospitals. A recent legal ruling on the lawsuits against Intui-tive Surgical sheds light on where the responsibility may lie for ensuring the safe introduction of new proce-dures. In 2013, Taylor v Intuitive, the first of at least 26 lawsuits against Intuitive, went to trial alleging injuries or death tied to the da Vinci Surgical System. This is the only case to date that has reached trial. 1 The patient underwent a robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy that was complicated by a markedly prolonged operating time and conversion to the open procedure. He experienced a collection of complica-tions, including a rectal laceration leading to reopera-tion and colostomy, sepsis, acute renal and respiratory failure, stroke, and incontinence. 2,3 The lawsuit was filed because of severe limitations in the patient's postop-erative functional quality of life; the plaintiffs argued that this debility accelerated his cardiovascular disease and led to his death 4 years later at age 71 years.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical skill evaluation ordinarily requires tedious video review and survey completion, while new automatic approaches focus on evaluating the quality of the surgeon's movements in free space. Robotic surgical instrument vibrations are simple to measure and physically correspond to how roughly instruments are handled, but they have yet to be studied as a measure of technical surgical skill. METHODS: Thirteen surgeons used a robotic surgery system (da Vinci S by Intuitive Surgical) to perform four trials each of peg transfer (PT), needle pass (NP), and intracorporeal suturing (IS). Completion time, instrument vibrations, and applied forces were measured for each trial; root mean square (RMS) and total sum of squares (TSS) were calculated from both the vibration and force recordings. Four experienced surgeons blindly assessed the task videos using a Global Rating Scale (GRS), and skill metrics were compared between the eight novices and five experienced participants. Stepwise regression was performed to predict GRS score from objective skill metrics. The concurrent validity of each metric was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The GRS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.91) and strong inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.84). Compared to novices, experienced surgeons earned higher GRS scores and performed tasks with lower vibration magnitudes, lower forces, and shorter completion times in 15 of 18 task-metric combinations (p values ranging from 0.042 to <0.001). ROC analysis demonstrated that including vibration and force magnitudes along with completion time in skill prediction models improves the objective classification of subjects as novice or experienced for all tasks studied (PT: 90 % sensitivity, 75 % specificity; NP: 85 % sensitivity, 84 % specificity; suturing: 100 % sensitivity, 100 % specificity). CONCLUSIONS: RMS and TSS instrument vibrations are novel construct-valid measures of robotic surgical skill that enable the development of objective skill assessment models comparable to observer-based ratings.},

Additionally, we have tried to design toward many of the characteristics that have made high frequency vibration the most common form of wearable tactile feedback, including low cost, light weight, comfort, and small size. Bolstered by largely positive comments from naive users during an informal testing session, we plan to continue improving these devices for future use in tactile motion guidance.},

This damping of force feedback is primarily due to the stiffness and inertia of the robot. The diminished perception of tool-to-eye interactions might put the eye tissue at high risk of injury due to excessive sclera forces or extreme insertion of the tool into the eye. In the present study therefore a 1-dimensional adaptive control method is customized for 3-dimensional control of sclera force components and tool insertion depth and then implemented on the velocity-controlled Johns Hopkins Steady-Hand Eye Robot. The control method enables the robot to perform autonomous motions to make the sclera force and/or insertion depth of the tool tip to follow pre-defined desired and safe trajectories when they exceed safe bounds. A robotic light pipe holding application in retinal surgery is also investigated using the adaptive control method. The implementation results indicate that the adaptive control is able to achieve the imposed safety margins and prevent sclera forces and insertion depth from exceeding safe boundaries.},

Analysis of these sources of information is a key step in defining objective criteria for characterizing surgical performance. The Blue DRAGON is a new system for acquiring the kinematics and the dynamics of two endoscopic tools synchronized with the endoscopic view of the surgical scene. Modeling the process of MIS using a finite state model [Markov model (MM)] reveals the internal structure of the surgical task and is utilized as one of the key steps in objectively assessing surgical performance. The experimental protocol includes tying an intracorporeal knot in a MIS setup performed on an animal model (pig) by 30 surgeons at different levels of training including expert surgeons. An objective learning curve was defined based on measuring quantitative statistical distance (similarity) between MM of experts and MM of residents at different levels of training. The objective learning curve was similar to that of the subjective performance analysis. The MM proved to be a powerful and compact mathematical model for decomposing a complex task such as laparoscopic suturing. Systems like surgical robots or virtual reality simulators in which the kinematics and the dynamics of the surgical tool are inherently measured may benefit from incorporation of the proposed methodology. © 2006 IEEE.},

This device is used as a spoon, which can suppress hand tremor in frequency range of 3–12 Hz. In this spoon, the piezoelectric devices are used as vibration sensor, energy harvester and vibration suppressor. To study application of the system, the governing electromechanical equations of motion are obtained and validated by experiment. Then to achieve best performance of the tremor suppressor, its parameters are justified concerning the tremor frequency. Furthermore, the electrical energy, which is harvested by the piezoelectric devices, is used to supply needed energy of electrical components of the device. Finally, it is shown that the designed spoon can effectively decrease the hand tremor and for frequency range of 3–12 Hz, this device is able to attenuate the tremor more than 80% during eating.},

   abstract = {The realism or transparency of haptic interfaces is becoming more critical as they are applied to training in fields like minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Surgical training simulators must provide a transparent virtual environment (VE) at a high update rate. Complex, deformable, cuttable tissue models have nonlinear dynamics and are computationally expensive, making it difficult to provide sufficient update rates. The objective of this work is to improve the transparency for this type of VE by formulating the unknown nonlinear dynamics as a quasi-linear parameter varying (LPV) system and designing a predictor to provide an output at a much higher update rate. An adaptive controller based on gain-scheduled prediction is considered for a nonlinear haptic device and a nonlinear, delayed, and sampled VE. The predictor uses feedback from the more accurate but slow-updating VE to update a simplified dynamic model. The predictor is designed based on numerical solutions to a linear matrix inequality derived using Lyapunov-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the gain-scheduled predictor approach and compare it to previous work using a constant-gain predictor. The gain-scheduled predictor results in significant performance improvements compared to a haptic system without prediction, but less significant improvement compared to the constant-gain approach.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a model of needle tissue interaction forces that a rigid suture needle experiences during surgical suturing. The needle-tissue interaction forces are modeled as the sum of lumped parameters. The model has three main components; friction, tissue compression, and cutting forces. The tissue compression force uses the area that the needle sweeps out during a suture to estimate both the force magnitude and force direction. The area that the needle sweeps out is a direct result of driving the needle in a way that does not follow the natural curve of the needle. The friction force is approximated as a static friction force along the shaft of the needle. The cutting force acts only on the needle tip. The resulting force and torque model is experimentally validated using a tissue phantom. These results indicate that the proposed lumped parameter model is capable of accurately modeling the forces experienced during a suture. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Tremor is a rhythmical and involuntary oscillatory movement of a body part and it is one of the most common movement disorders. Orthotic devices have been under investigation as a noninvasive tremor suppression alternative to medication or surgery. The challenge in musculoskeletal tremor suppression is estimating and attenuating the tremor motion without impeding the patient's intentional motion. In this research a robust tremor suppression algorithm was derived for patients with pathological tremor in the upper limbs. First the motion in the tremor frequency range is estimated using a high-pass filter. Then, by applying the backstepping method the appropriate amount of torque is calculated to drive the output of the estimator toward zero. This is equivalent to an estimation of the tremor torque. It is shown that the arm/orthotic device control system is stable and the algorithm is robust despite inherent uncertainties in the open-loop human arm joint model. A human arm joint simulator, capable of emulating tremorous motion of a human arm joint was used to evaluate the proposed suppression algorithm experimentally for two types of tremor, Parkinson and essential. Experimental results show 30-42 dB (97.5-99.2%) suppression of tremor with minimal effect on the intentional motion. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This paper focuses on an automated analysis of surgical motion profiles for objective skill assessment and task recognition in robot-assisted surgery. Existing techniques heavily rely on conventional statistic measures or shallow modelings based on hand-engineered features and gesture segmentation. Such developments require significant expert knowledge, are prone to errors, and are less efficient in online adaptive training systems. Methods: In this work, we present an efficient analytic framework with a parallel deep learning architecture, SATR-DL, to assess trainee expertise and recognize surgical training activity. Through an end-to-end learning technique, abstract information of spatial representations and temporal dynamics is jointly obtained directly from raw motion sequences. Results: By leveraging a shared highlevel representation learning, the resulting model is successful in the recognition of trainee skills and surgical tasks, suturing, needle-passing, and knot-tying. Meanwhile, we explore the use of ensemble in classification at the trial level, where the SATR-DL outperforms state-of-the-art performance by achieving accuracies of 0.960 and 1.000 in skill assessment and task recognition, respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights the potential of SATR-DL to provide improvements for an efficient data-driven assessment in intelligent robotic surgery.},

This paper provides tools for quantifying teleoperation system performance and stability when communication delays are present. A general multivariable system architecture is utilized which includes all four types of data transmission between master and slave: force and velocity in both directions. It is shown that a proper use of all four channels is of critical importance in achieving high performance telepresence in the sense of accurate transmission of task impedances to the operator. It is also shown that transparency and robust stability (passivity) are conflicting design goals in teleoperation systems. The analysis is illustrated by comparing transparency and stability in two common architectures, as well as a recent “passivated” approach and a new “transparency optimized” architecture, using simplified one degree of freedom examples. © 1993 IEEE},

The active spinners are 3D-printed disks, 1 cm in diameter, that have an embedded fan-like structure, such that a sub-levitating up-flow of air forces them to spin. Single spinners exhibit Brownian motion with a narrow Gaussian velocity distribution function, P(v), for translational motion. We study the evolution of P(v) as the packing fraction and the average single particle spin speeds are varied. The interparticle hydrodynamic interaction is negligible, and the dynamics is dominated by hyperelastic collisions and dissipative forces. As expected for nonequilibrium systems, P(v) for a collection of many spinners deviates from Gaussian behavior. However, unlike translationally active systems, phase separation is not observed, and the system remains spatially homogeneous. We then search for a near-equilibrium counterpart for our active spinners by measuring the equation of state. Interestingly, it agrees well with a hard-sphere model, despite the dissipative nature of the single particle dynamics.},

   abstract = {Background: The loss of tactile feedback in minimally invasive robotic surgery remains a major challenge to the expanding field. With visual cue compensation alone, tissue characterization via palpation proves to be immensely difficult. This work evaluates a bimodal vibrotactile system as a means of conveying applied forces to simulate haptic feedback in two sets of studies simulating an artificial palpation task using the da Vinci surgical robot. Methods: Subjects in the first study were tasked with localizing an embedded vessel in a soft tissue phantom using a single-sensor unit. In the second study, subjects localized tumor-like structures using a three-sensor array. In both sets of studies, subjects completed the task under three trial conditions: no feedback, normal force tactile feedback, and hybrid vibrotactile feedback. Recordings of correct localization, incorrect localization, and time-to-completion were used to evaluate performance outcomes. Results: With the addition of vibrotactile and pneumatic feedback, significant improvements in the percentage of correct localization attempts were detected (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0459, respectively) during the first experiment with phantom vessels. Similarly, significant improvements in correct localization were found with the addition of vibrotactile (p = 2.57E−5) and pneumatic significance (p = 8.54E−5) were observed in the second experiment involving tumor phantoms. Conclusions: This work demonstrates not only the superior benefits of a multi-modal feedback over traditional single-modality feedback, but also the effectiveness of vibration in providing haptic feedback to artificial palpation systems.},

   abstract = {Achieving dexterous volitional control of an upper-limb prosthetic device will require multimodal sensory feedback that goes beyond vision. Haptic display is well-positioned to provide this additional sensory information. Haptic display, however, includes a diverse set of modalities that encode information differently. We have begun to make a comparison between two of these modalities, force feedback spanning the elbow, and amplitude-modulated vibrotactile feedback, based on performance in a functional grasp and lift task. In randomly ordered trials, we assessed the performance of N=11 participants (8 able-bodied, 3 amputee) attempting to grasp and lift an object using an EMG controlled gripper under three feedback conditions (no feedback, vibrotactile feedback, and force feed-back), and two object weights that were undetectable by vision. Preliminary results indicate differences between able-bodied and amputee participants in coordination of grasp and lift forces. In addition, both force feedback and vibrotactile feedback contribute to significantly better task performance (fewer slips) and better adaptation following an unpredicted weight change. This suggests that the development and utilization of internal models for predictive control is more intuitive in the presence of haptic feedback. © 2013 IEEE.},

Results: There were no complications. The depth and location of the interrupted and running sutures were confirmed postmortem. Conclusions: The transabdominal sutures and tackers used in laparoscopic ventral hernia repair can be the focus for postoperative pain and adhesions. As an alternative, the da Vinci Robot can be used to facilitate intracorporeal suturing of the mesh directly to the fascial edge and to secure the circumference of the mesh to the posterior fascia.

Recently, the Senhance™ surgical robotic system was introduced as a novel robotic platform designed to overcome some of the limits of standard laparoscopy. This study describes the initial, single-center experience, evaluating feasibility and safety of the new robotic system in performing colorectal surgical procedures. Methods: From June 2015 to November 2016, perioperative data of the first 45 patients who underwent robotic colorectal surgery with the Senhance™ surgical robotic system were collected and analysed. Indications for surgery included inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, endoscopically unresectable adenomas and complicated diverticular disease. Results: The median age of patients was 57 (range: 18–92) years and the median body mass index (BMI) was 24 (range: 16–30) kg/m2. Surgical indications were colorectal cancer (66%), complicated inflammatory bowel disease (18%), diverticular disease (11%) and endoscopically unresectable adenoma (4.4%). The median operative time was 256 minutes, and the median docking time was 10.7 (range: 2–25) min. There were three conversions to standard laparoscopy and none to laparotomy. All patients operated on for malignancy (28 adenocarcinoma and 2 neuroendocrine tumours) underwent an appropriate oncological procedure. The median time to discharge was 5 (range: 3–19) days. The incidence of postoperative complications was 35.5% (Clavien–Dindo I/II, 14 patients; and Clavien–Dindo III, two patients). One patient was readmitted in the postoperative period. No patient required reoperation. Conclusion: The results of this audit suggest that adoption of the Senhance™ surgical robotic system in colorectal surgery is feasible and safe. More clinical data are needed to determine whether this approach can offer any other benefits over other minimally invasive surgical techniques.},

The investigators hypothesized laser osteotomy would render acceptable bone healing based on the intraoperative findings and postoperative cut surface analysis. Study Design/Materials and Methods: We designed and implemented a comparative bone-cutting surgery in the minipig mandible with a cold ablation robot-guided Er:YAG laser osteotome (CARLO) and a piezoelectric (PZE) osteotome. The sample was composed of different patterns of defects in the mandibles of six grown-up female Goettingen minipigs. The predictor variable was Er:YAG osteotomy and PZE osteotomy. The outcome variable was the cut surface characteristics and bone healing at 4 and 8 weeks postoperatively. Descriptive and qualitative comparison was executed. Results: The sample was composed of four kinds of bone defects on both sides of the mandibles of six minipigs. We observed more bleeding during the operation, open-cut surfaces, and a faster healing pattern with the laser osteotomy. There was a possible association between the intraoperative findings, postoperative cut surface analysis, and the bone healing pattern. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that characteristic open-cut surfaces could explain favorable bone healing after laser osteotomy. Future studies will focus on the quantification of the early healing characteristics after laser osteotomy, its diverse application, and the safety feature. Lasers Surg.

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

   abstract = {We propose a new electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system for an intravascular microrobot with steering, locomotion and drilling functions. The EMA system consists of 3 pairs of Helmholtz coil and 1 pair of Maxwell coil. Generally, Helmholtz coils can align a microrobot in a desired direction by generating a uniform magnetic flux. If the uniform magnetic field generated by Helmholtz coils can be rotated, a microrobot with Helmholtz coils can also be rotated. On the other hand, a Maxwell coil, which generates a constant gradient magnetic flux, can supply the propulsion force for the microrobot. A microrobot actuated by the proposed EMA system has a spiral shaped body containing two magnets with different magnetization directions. With the proposed EMA system, the microrobot can move to the target region and perform drilling there by the precessional magnetic field of the Helmholtz coil pairs. The propulsion force for the microrobot is produced by the gradient magnetic field generated by the Maxwell coil pair. The moving velocity and the drilling performance of the microrobot can be increased by the propulsion force of the Maxwell coil pair. Through various tests, the feasibility and enhancement of the microrobot actuated by the proposed EMA system were verified. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

MATCHING tasks compared his ability to position the EMG limb to conform with the flexion of his normal (contralateral) elbow. Computer reduction of almost 9000 individual trials and analysis of variance indicated that for the EMG limb the tactile feedback with sound occluded reduced errors by 50 percent. Terminal device load did not significantly affect positioningperformance due to the force proprioception built into the Boston Arm. In comparison with the standard mechanical prosthesis, the EMG limb with feedback achieves virtually identical kinesthetic performance. The display is completely compatible with the EMG control, causes no discomfort to the wearer, and is not significantly degraded by the environmental conditions of the limb socket.},

   abstract = {How does the magnitude of the exploration force influence the precision of haptic perceptual estimates? To address this question, we examined the perceptual precision for moment of inertia (i.e., an object's "angular mass") under different force conditions, using the Weber fraction to quantify perceptual precision. Participants rotated a rod around a fixed axis and judged its moment of inertia in a two-alternative forced-choice task. We instructed different levels of exploration force, thereby manipulating the magnitude of both the exploration force and the angular acceleration. These are the two signals that are needed by the nervous system to estimate moment of inertia. Importantly, one can assume that the absolute noise on both signals increases with an increase in the signals' magnitudes, while the relative noise (i.e., noise/signal) decreases with an increase in signal magnitude. We examined how the perceptual precision for moment of inertia was affected by this neural noise. In a first experiment we found that a low exploration force caused a higher Weber fraction (22%) than a high exploration force (13%), which suggested that the perceptual precision was constrained by the relative noise. This hypothesis was supported by the result of a second experiment, in which we found that the relationship between exploration force and Weber fraction had a similar shape as the theoretical relationship between signal magnitude and relative noise. The present study thus demonstrated that the amount of force used to explore an object can profoundly influence the precision by which its properties are perceived. © 2012 Debats et al.},

In this paper, the relative roles of force/displacement and surface deformation cues are investigated. We have measured discrimination thresholds with silicone rubber stimuli of differing thickness and compliance. Also, the influence of the finger span is assessed. When compliance is expressed as the Young's modulus, the thresholds in the different conditions follow Weber's law with a Weber fraction of 15 percent. When the surface deformation cue was removed, thresholds more than trebled. Under the assumption of optimal cue combination, this suggests that a large fraction of the information comes from the surface deformation cue. Using a matching experiment, we found that differences in object thickness are correctly taken into account. When cues appear to contradict each other, the conflict is resolved by means of a compromise. © 2009 IEEE.},

   abstract = {To be successful, precision manipulation of small objects requires a refined coordination of forces excerted on the object by the tips of the fingers and thumb. The present paper deals quantitatively with the regulation of the coordination between the grip force and the vertical lifting force, denoted as the load force, while small objects were lifted, positioned in space and replaced by human subjects using the pinch grip. It was shown that the grip force changed in parallel with the load force generated by the subject to overcome various forces counteracting the intended manipulation. The balance between the two forces was adapted to the friction between the skin and the object providing a relatively small safety margin to prevent slips, i.e. the more slippery the object the higher the grip force at any given load force. Experiments with local anaesthesia indicated that this adaptation was dependent on cutaneous afferent input. Afferent information related to the frictional condition could influence the force coordination already about 0.1 s after the object was initially gripped, i.e. approximately at the time the grip and load forces began to increase in parallel. Further, "secondary", adjustments of the force balance could occur later in response to small short-lasting slips, revealed as vibrations in the object. The new force balance following slips was maintained, indicating that the relationship between the two forces was set on the basis of a memory trace. Its updating was most likely accounted for by tactile afferent information entering intermittently at inappropriate force coordination, e.g. as during slips. The latencies between the onset of such slips and the appearance of the adjustments (0.06-0.08 s) clearly indicated that the underlying neural mechanisms operated highly automatically. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.},

I do so through two studies: a two-year, five-sited, comparative ethnographic study of learning in robotic and traditional surgical practice, and a blinded interview-based study of surgical learning practices at 13 top-tier teaching hospitals around the U.S. I found that learning surgery through increasing participation using approved methods worked well in traditional (open) surgery, as current literature would predict. But the radically different practice of robotic surgery greatly limited trainees’ role in the work, making approved methods ineffective. Learning surgery in this context required what I call “shadow learning”: an interconnected set of norm- and policy-challenging practices enacted extensively, opportunistically, and in relative isolation that allowed only a minority of robotic surgical trainees to come to competence. Successful trainees engaged extensively in three practices: “premature specialization” in robotic surgical technique at the expense of generalist training; “abstract rehearsal” before and during their surgical rotations when concrete, empirically faithful rehearsal was prized; and “undersupervised struggle,” in which they performed robotic surgical work close to the edge of their capacity with little expert supervision—when norms and policy dictated such supervision. Shadow learning practices were neither punished nor forbidden, and they contributed to significant and troubling outcomes for the cadre of initiate surgeons and the profession, including hyperspecialization and a decreasing supply of experts relative to demand.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of a telemanipulator requires special training and surgical performance is associated with a learning curve. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential value of Haptic-Visual over Visual-Only passive Training in telemanipulator-assisted surgery. METHODS: Two telemanipulator consoles (da Vinci, Intuitive Surgical) were linked through an Application Programer's Interface allowing the applicant at the training console to register the position and passively follow the motions of the instructor's master telemanipulators (MTMs) at the master console (Haptic-Visual Learning group, HVL). The applicant could not actively interfere with the MTM movements. Both the trainee and the instructor shared the same 3-dimensional vision. Alternatively, subjects received only standard visual training without touching the MTMs (Visual-Only Learning group, VL). A standardized demonstration of tasks and the system was given for both groups. Participants (n=20) without previous experience with telemanipulation performed a set of various tasks in a randomized order. Study end points were time and accuracy required to perform the different task. RESULTS: The first task, with moving items to appropriate locations, showed differences in time to perform the task [mean: 4:06 min (HVL) vs. 5:16 min (VL) (P=0.2)] and accuracy differed among groups [mean number of errors 1.7 (VL) vs. 1.3 (HVL) P=0.38]. With more challenging tasks [cut out round figures (cut) and performing double dot suture lines (sti)] the number of errors was less in the HVL group [mean: 1.1 errors (cut) (P=0.05) and 1.8 errors (sti) (P=0.26)] compared with the VL group [mean: 1.8 errors (cut) and 2.3 errors (sti)]. In addition, the time to perform the tasks decreased in the HVL group with mean: 5.42 minutes (cut) (P=0.26) and 9.41 minutes (sti) (P=0.36) compared with the VL group with mean: 7.09 minutes (cut) and 11.43 minutes (sti).

This can be disruptive or annoying when the user needs to focus on another task of higher importance. We believe that haptic feedback that elicits positive affect can manage attention capture across a wider spectrum than feedback with negative affect. In this study, we explore the affective response to several haptic actuator designs for better management of user attention. We evaluate six parameters that may impact affect: stimulus location on the body, actuation type, actuation intensity, actuation profile, actuator material and actuator geometry. A total of 30 subjects participated in this study (average age 24±3 years). Of the six parameters, we found that actuation profile had the most significant impact on affect. We also found that devices with negative affect were better able to capture the user's attention. Due to the variability in the verbalized preferences among subjects, we propose outfitting all haptic actuators with an intensity control. We anticipate that the results of this study will guide designers in modifying key parameters of haptic devices to appropriately manage user attention. © 2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Developed to educate dental students in caries detection, the VerroTeach simulator allows dental faculty to share, record, and replay the tactile vibrations felt through a dental hand instrument.We assessed this simulation approach by asking experienced dental educators to evaluate the system's real-time and video playback modes. Methods: VerroTeach uses an accelerometer to sense instrument vibrations and a voice coil actuator to reproduce these vibrations on another tool. Seventeen dental faculty participated in the study, first experiencing real-time mode by feeling vibrations while the experimenter touched extracted teeth. The subject then experienced vibrotactile playback of 5 prerecorded caries detection tasks and 1 prerecorded caries extraction procedure, making 10 total caries judgments and repeatedly rating the system's perceptual accuracy. Results: Dental educators rated caries detection as significantly more difficult for students than experienced dentists (P < 0.0001), and they rated tactile feedback as a highly important source of information for this judgment. Subjects highly rated the realism of both real-time mode and playback mode. Experienced dentists performed well on the simulator, answering most questions correctly. Interestingly, nonpracticing dentists performed significantly worse than practicing dentists on the caries judgment questions (P = 0.003). Finally, subjects strongly recommended the system for training dental students. Conclusions: These positive results indicate that sharing, recording, and replaying instrument vibrations may be beneficial for teaching caries detection to dental students. Further research is planned to improve tactile feedback quality, integrate VerroTeach into the preclinical curriculum, and explore other possible applications for this approach to clinical simulation.},

The purpose of this review is to highlight the status of simulation in surgical education, including available simulator options, and to briefly discuss the future impact of these modalities on surgical training. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

To simplify the modeling process and enable the use of single-axis actuators, these previous efforts have used just one axis of a three-dimensional vibration signal, even though the main vibration mechanoreceptors in the hand are know to detect vibrations in all directions. Furthermore, the fact that these mechanoreceptors are largely insensitive to the direction of high-frequency vibrations points to the existence of a transformation that can reduce three-dimensional high-frequency vibration signals to a one-dimensional signal without appreciable perceptual degradation. After formalizing the requirements for this transformation, this paper describes and compares several candidate methods of varying degrees of sophistication, culminating in a novel frequency-domain solution that performs very well on our chosen metrics. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Recent studies have proposed importance of both genetic predisposition and accumulated amount of practice for standing at the top of fields of sports and performing arts. In contrast to the two factors, what is unexplored is how one practices impacts on experts' expertise. Here, we show that training of active somatosensory function (active haptic training) enhances precise force control in the keystrokes and somatosensory functions specifically of expert pianists, but not of untrained individuals. By contrast, training that merely repeats the task with provision of error feedback, which is a typical training method, failed to improve the force control in the experts, but not in the untrained. These findings provide evidence that the limit of highly trained motor skills could be overcome by optimizing training methods.},

This article investigates the effects of one machine-learning-based skill-assessment approach on psychomotor skill development in robotic surgery training. Methods: N = 29 trainees (medical students and residents) with no robotic surgery experience performed five trials of inanimate peg transfer with an Intuitive Surgical da Vinci Standard robot. Half of the participants received no post-trial feedback. The other half received automatically calculated scores from five Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skill domains post-trial. Results: There were no significant differences between the groups regarding overall improvement or skill improvement rate. However, participants who received post-trial feedback rated their overall performance improvement significantly lower than participants who did not receive feedback. Conclusions: These findings indicate that automated skill evaluation systems might improve trainee self-awareness but not accelerate early stage psychomotor skill development in robotic surgery training.},

   abstract = {Importance: Increasing use of robotic surgery for common surgical procedures with limited evidence and unclear clinical benefit is raising concern. Analyses of population-based trends in practice and how hospitals' acquisition of robotic surgical technologies is associated with their use are limited. Objective: To characterize trends in the use of robotic surgery for common surgical procedures. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used clinical registry data from Michigan from January 1, 2012, through June 30, 2018. Trends were characterized in the use of robotic surgery for common procedures for which traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery was already considered a safe and effective approach for most surgeons when clinically feasible. A multigroup interrupted time series analysis was performed to determine how procedural approaches (open, laparoscopic, and robotic) change after hospitals launch a robotic surgery program. Data were analyzed from March 1 through April 19, 2019. Exposures: Initiation of robotic surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: Procedure approach (ie, robotic, open, or laparoscopic). Results: The study cohort included 169404 patients (mean [SD] age, 55.4 [16.9] years; 90595 women [53.5%]) at 73 hospitals. The use of robotic surgery increased from 1.8% in 2012 to 15.1% in 2018 (8.4-fold increase; slope, 2.1% per year; 95% CI, 1.9%-2.3%). For certain procedures, the magnitude of the increase was greater; for example, for inguinal hernia repair, the use of robotic surgery increased from 0.7% to 28.8% (41.1-fold change; slope, 5.4% per year; 95% CI, 5.1%-5.7%). The use of robotic surgery increased 8.8% in the first 4 years after hospitals began performing robotic surgery (2.8% per year; 95% CI, 2.7%-2.9%). This trend was associated with a decrease in laparoscopic surgery from 53.2% to 51.3% (difference, -1.9%; 95% CI, -2.2% to -1.6%). Before adopting robotic surgery, hospitals' use of laparoscopic surgery increased 1.3% per year. After adopting robotic surgery, the use of laparoscopic surgery declined 0.3% (difference in trends, -1.6%; 95% CI, -1.7% to -1.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: These results suggest that robotic surgery has continued to diffuse across a broad range of common surgical procedures. Hospitals that launched robotic surgery programs had a broad and immediate increase in the use of robotic surgery, which was associated with a decrease in traditional laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery.},

   abstract = {Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery has gained widespread use over the past decade, but the technique is currently operated in the absence of haptic feedback during tissue manipulation. We have developed a complete tactile feedback system, consisting of a piezoresistive force sensor, control system, and pneumatic balloon tactile display, and mounted directly onto a da Vinci surgical robotic system. To evaluate the effect of tactile feedback on robotic manipulation, a group of novices (n = 16) and experts (n = 4) were asked to perform three blocks of peg transfer tasks with the tactile feedback system in place. Force generated at the end-effectors was measured in all three blocks, but tactile feedback was active only during the middle block. All subjects used higher force when the feedback system was inactive. When active, subjects immediately used substantially less force and still maintained appropriate grip during the task. After the system was again turned off, grip force increased significantly to prefeedback levels. These results demonstrate that robotic manipulations without tactile feedback are done with more force than needed to grasp objects. Therefore, the addition of tactile feedback allows the surgeon to grasp with less force, and may improve control of the robotic system and handling of tissues and other objects. © 2009 IEEE.},

Some of the reasons for such degradation in the feedback of touch are that (1) the instruments include hinge mechanisms with significant friction, (2) the cannulae through which instruments are inserted introduce friction [6], and (3) the contact forces at the instrument tip can sometimes be very small compared with the relatively large forces supplied by the arm to move the instrument mass and the unsupported hand. As a result of this degradation in the haptic sensation for the surgeon, surgical tasks requiring accurate feeling of tissue characteristics such as palpation are difficult to perform in the minimally invasive mode. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

   abstract = {The multifaceted human sense of touch is fundamental to direct manipulation, but technical challenges prevent most teleoperation systems from providing even a single modality of haptic feedback, such as force feedback. This paper postulates that ungrounded grip-force, fingertip-contact-and-pressure, and high-frequency acceleration haptic feedback will improve human performance of a teleoperated pick-and-place task. Thirty subjects used a teleoperation system consisting of a haptic device worn on the subject's right hand, a remote PR2 humanoid robot, and a Vicon motion capture system to move an object to a target location. Each subject completed the pick-and-place task 10 times under each of the eight haptic conditions obtained by turning on and off grip-force feedback, contact feedback, and acceleration feedback. To understand how object stiffness affects the utility of the feedback, half of the subjects completed the task with a flexible plastic cup, and the others used a rigid plastic block. The results indicate that the addition of grip-force feedback with gain switching enables subjects to hold both the flexible and rigid objects more stably, and it also allowed subjects who manipulated the rigid block to hold the object more delicately and to better control the motion of the remote robot's hand. Contact feedback improved the ability of subjects who manipulated the flexible cup to move the robot's arm in space, but it deteriorated this ability for subjects who manipulated the rigid block. Contact feedback also caused subjects to hold the flexible cup less stably, but the rigid block more securely. Finally, adding acceleration feedback slightly improved the subject's performance when setting the object down, as originally hypothesized; interestingly, it also allowed subjects to feel vibrations produced by the robot's motion, causing them to be more careful when completing the task. This study supports the utility of grip-force and high-frequency acceleration feedback in teleoperation systems and motivates further improvements to fingertip-contact-and-pressure feedback.},

   abstract = {We present a new method to generate spatial motion constraints for surgical robots that provide sophisticated ways to assist the surgeon. Surgical robotic assistant systems are human-machine collaborative systems (HMCS) that work interactively with surgeons by augmenting their ability to manipulate surgical instruments in carrying out a variety of surgical tasks. The goal of "virtual fixtures" (VF) is to provide anisotropic motion behavior to the surgeon's motion command and to filter out tremor to enhance precision and stability. Our method uses a weighted, linearized, multi-objective optimization framework to formalize a library of virtual fixtures for task primitives. We set the objective function based on user input that can be obtained through a force sensor, joystick or a master robot. We set the linearized subject function based on five basic geometric constraints. The strength of this approach is that it is extensible to include additional constraints such as collision avoidance, anatomy-based constraints and joint limits, by using an instantaneous kinematic relationship between the task variables and robot joints. We illustrate our approach using three surgical tasks: percutaneous needle insertion, femur cutting for prosthetic implant and suturing. For the percutaneous procedures we provide a remote center of motion (RCM) point that provides an isocentric motion that is fundamental to these types of procedures. For femur cutting procedures we provide assistance by maintaining proper tool orientation and position. For the suturing task we address the problem of stitching in endoscopic surgery using a circular needle. We show that with help of VF, suturing can be performed at awkward angles without multiple trials, thus avoiding damage to tissue. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to assess robot-assisted suturing skills on a laparoscopic intestinal anastomosis model by using a novel computerized objective assessment system. METHODS: This study compared the suturing skills of 13 surgically naïve participants on an artificial intestinal anastomosis model that mimics real tissue. Each examinee sutured using da Vinci robot assistance under 2-D and 3-D visualization and with conventional laparoscopy (CL). Pressure-measuring and image-processing devices were employed to quantitatively evaluate suturing skills. Five unique criteria were used to evaluate the skills of participants. RESULTS: Suturing under 3-D visualization (P < 0.01) and with CL (P < 0.05) were significantly faster than under 2-D visualization. Sutures placed under 3-D (P < 0.05) and 2-D (P < 0.01) visualization had significantly better suture tension than those placed with CL, which did not meet acceptable values for suture tension. Sutures placed with CL had significantly better air pressure leakage than those placed under 2-D visualization (P < 0.05), which did not meet acceptable values for air pressure leakage and wound opening area. One participants failed to achieve full-thickness sutures with 2-D, two participants with CL, and one participant with 3-D. CONCLUSION: Using 3-D vision is necessary for complex maneuvering during robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Our quantitative assessment system is useful for evaluating the skill acquisition of surgeon-trainees undergoing robotic surgery training.},

   abstract = {An important goal of haptic display is to make available the action/reaction relationships that define interactions between the body and the physical world. While in physical world interactions reaction cues invariably impinge on the same part of the body involved in action (reaction and action are colocated), a haptic interface is quite capable of rendering feedback to a separate body part than that used for producing exploratory actions (non-colocated action and reaction). This most commonly occurs with the use of vibrotactile display, in which a cutaneous cue has been substituted for a kinesthetic cue (a kind of sensory substitution). In this paper, we investigate whether non-colocated force and displacement cues degrade the perception of compliance. Using a custom non-colocated kinesthetic display in which one hand controls displacement and the other senses force, we ask participants to discriminate between two virtual springs with matched terminal force and adjustable non-linearity. An additional condition includes one hand controlling displacement while the other senses force encoded in a vibrotactile cue. Results show that when the terminal force cue is unavailable, and even when sensory substitution is not involved, non-colocated kinesthetic displays degrade compliance discrimination relative to colocated kinesthetic displays. Compliance discrimination is also degraded with vibrotactile display of force. These findings suggest that non-colocated kinesthetic displays and, likewise, cutaneous sensory substitution displays should be avoided when discrimination of compliance is necessary for task success.},

   abstract = {Objectives. To evaluate two currently available robotic surgical systems in performing various urologic laparoscopic procedures in an acute porcine model. Methods. Robotic laparoscopic surgery was performed in 14 swine. Data were compared between the da Vinci Robotic System and the Zeus Robotic System. Results. During laparoscopic nephrectomy, the da Vinci System (n = 6) had a significantly shorter total operating room time (51.3 versus 71.6 minutes; P = 0.02) and actual surgical time (42.1 versus 61.4 minutes; P = 0.03) compared with the Zeus System (n = 5). However, the blood loss and adequacy of surgical dissection were comparable between the two groups. For laparoscopic adrenalectomy, the da Vinci System (n = 5) had a shorter actual surgical time (12.2 versus 26.0 minutes; P = 0.006) than did the Zeus System (n = 5). For laparoscopic pyeloplasty, the da Vinci System had a shorter total operating room time (61.4 versus 83.4 minutes; P = 0.10) and anastomotic time (44.7 versus 66.4 minutes; P = 0.11). During pyeloplasty anastomosis, the total number of suture bites per ureter was 13.0 for the da Vinci System (n = 6) and 10.8 for the Zeus System (n = 6). The complications included an adrenal parenchymal tear each during a da Vinci System-based left adrenalectomy and a Zeus System-based right adrenalectomy. An inferior vena caval tear during a Zeus System-based right adrenalectomy occurred in 1 case, which was suture-repaired telerobotically. Conclusions. Robotic laparoscopic procedures can be performed effectively using either the da Vinci or Zeus System. In this limited study, the learning curve and operative times were shorter and the intraoperative technical movements appeared inherently more intuitive with the da Vinci System.

The results of this experiment demonstrated that increasing levels of resistive torques decreased movement speed variability only until a certain torque level. This observation indicates that a motor-unit pool-based muscle force generation variability, which is known to increase at low force levels, can indeed underlie increased variability in slow movements. Our results imply that resistive torques may be used to significantly decrease movement speed variability, opening up new possibilities for novel assistive devices for motor skill augmentation.},

   abstract = {Aim: To investigate the effect of qualitatively different types of pedagogical feedback (FB) on the training, transfer and retention of basic manual dexterity dental skills using a virtual reality (VR) haptic dental simulator. Methods: Sixty-three participants (M = 22.7 years; SD = 3.4 years), with no previous dental training, were randomly allocated to one of three groups (n = 21 each). Group 1 received device-only feedback during the training phase, that is the visual display of the simulator (DFB); Group 2 received verbal feedback from a qualified dental instructor (IFB); and Group 3 received a combination of instructor and device feedback (IDFB). Participants completed four tasks during which feedback was given according to group allocation as well as two skills transfer tests. Skill retention was examined immediately after training, at 1 week and at 1 month post-test. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between the groups in overall performance (P < 0.001) and error (P = 0.006). Post hoc comparisons revealed the IDFB group produced substantially better performance and fewer errors in comparison with DFB and IFB training. This difference translated to improved performance in skill retention and generalisation of knowledge to novel tasks. Conclusion: These data indicate that the acquisition and retention of basic dental motor skills in novice trainees is best optimised through a combination of instructor and visual display (VR)-driven feedback. The results have implications for the utility and implementation of VR haptic technology in dental education.},

   abstract = {Surgery has increasingly become a technology-driven specialty. Robotic assistance is considered one innovation within abdominal surgery over the past decade that has the potential to compensate for the drawbacks of conventional laparoscopy. The dramatic evolution of robotic surgery over the past 10 years is likely to be eclipsed by even greater advances over the next decade. We review the current status of robotic technology in surgery. The Medline database was searched for the terms "robotic surgery, telesurgery, and laparoscopy." A total of 2,496 references were found. All references were considered for information on robotic surgery in advanced laparoscopy. Further references were obtained through cross-referencing the bibliography cited in each work. There is a paucity of control studies on a sufficient number of subjects in robot-assisted surgeries in all fields. Studies that meet more stringent clinical trials criteria show that robot-assisted surgery appears comparable to traditional surgery in terms of feasibility and outcomes but that costs associated with robot-assisted surgery are higher because of longer operating times and expense of equipment. While a limited number of studies on the da Vinci robotic system have proven the benefit of this approach in regard to patient outcomes, including significantly reduced blood loss, lower percentage of postoperative complications, and shorter hospital stays, there are mechanical and institutional risks that must be more fully addressed. Robotic assistance will remain an intensively discussed subject since clinical benefits for most procedures have not yet been proven. While the benefit still remains open to discussion, robotic systems are spreading and are available worldwide in tertiary centers. © 2012 Association of Surgeons of India.},

   abstract = {Surgery is a challenging domain for motor skill acquisition, and compounding this difficulty is the often delayed and qualitative nature of feedback that is provided to trainees. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of providing real-time feedback of movement smoothness, a characteristic associated with skilled and coordinated movement, via a vibrotactile cue. Subjects performed a mirror-tracing task that requires coordination and dexterity similar in nature to that required in endovascular surgery. Movement smoothness, measured by spectral arc length, a frequency-domain measure of movement smoothness, was encoded in a vibrotactile cue. Performance of the mirror tracing task with smoothness-based feedback was compared to position-based feedback (where the subject was alerted when they moved outside the path boundary) and to a no-feedback control condition. Although results of this pilot study failed to indicate a statistically significant effect of smoothness-based feedback on performance, subjects receiving smoothness-based feedback altered their task completion strategies to improve speed and accuracy, while those receiving position-based feedback or no feedback only improved in terms of increased accuracy. In tasks such as surgery where both speed and accuracy are vital to positive patient outcomes, the provision of smoothness-based feedback to the surgeon has the potential to positively influence performance.},

The purpose of this study was to assess whether or not such a discrepancy exists. Methods: We administered survey questionnaires via face-to-face interviews with surgical patients (n = 101), healthcare providers (n = 58), and senior members of hospital administration (n = 6) at a community hospital that performs robotic surgery. The respondents were asked about their perception regarding the infection rate, operative time, operative blood loss, incision size, cost, length of hospital stay (LOS), risk of complications, precision and accuracy, tactile sensation, and technique of robotic-assisted surgery as compared with conventional laparoscopic surgery. We then performed a comprehensive literature review to assess whether or not these perceptions could be corroborated with clinical evidence. Results: The majority of survey respondents perceived RAS as modality to decrease infection rate, increase operative time, decrease operative blood loss, smaller incision size, a shorter LOS, and a lower risk of complications, while increasing the cost. Respondents also believed that robotic surgery provides greater precision, accuracy, and tactile sensation, while improving intra-operative access to organs. A comprehensive literature review found little-to-no clinical evidence that supported the respondent’s favorable perceptions of robotic surgery except for the increased costs, and precision and accuracy of the robotic-assisted technique. Conclusions: There is a discrepancy between the perceptions of robotic surgery and the clinical evidence among patients, healthcare providers, and hospital administrators surveyed.},

   abstract = {Background: Vibrotactile feedback (VIB) has been utilized in previous research as sensory augmentation to improve performance during minimally invasive surgical tasks. Stochastic resonance (SR), introduced into the human control system as white noise at a subthreshold level, has shown promise to improve the sensitivity of tactile receptors resulting in performance enhancement for sensorimotor tasks. The purpose of this study was to determine whether SR could improve performance (accuracy, speed) in a simulated laparoscopic palpation task. Methods: Sixteen subjects performed a palpation task using a laparoscopic tool to detect the presence of tumors (compacted felt) embedded in simulated tissue samples (silicone gel) inside a laparoscopic trainer box. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four different conditions: (1) SR, (2) VIB, (3) VIB + SR, and (4) Control. The VIB and SR signals were administered via two separate haptic actuators attached to the subjects’ dominant upper arms and forearms, respectively. All subjects were presented with 36 tissue samples with no sensory augmentation (Control) to establish baseline, followed by another 36 samples under one of the randomly assigned vibration conditions (SR, VIB, VIB + SR, or Control). Results: Results show a significantly larger improvement in tumor detection accuracy in the SR group compared to the VIB and Control groups. There was no difference in the time to task completion, indicating that there was no speed–accuracy trade-off. Conclusions: The results have implications for the design of instruments and methods for increasing detection accuracy such as in palpation tasks. This technology could help surgeons better identify tumors located in healthy surrounding tissue.},

   abstract = {Study Objective: To compare gynecologic practice and perioperative outcomes of patients undergoing total laparoscopic hysterectomy and robotic hysterectomy before and after implementation of a robotics program. Design: A retrospective chart review of the last 200 consecutive hysterectomy cases completed before and after implementation of a robotics program (Canadian Task Force classification III). Setting: Community hospital. Patients: All patients requiring hysterectomy for benign indications between November 2004 and January 2007. Interventions: Patients were candidates for total laparoscopic, abdominal, or vaginal hysterectomy before February 2006 and were candidates for total laparoscopic, total abdominal, total vaginal, or robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy after February 2006. Perioperative characteristics and trends were studied. Measurements and Main Results: In all, 100 patients intended to be treated by laparoscopic hysterectomy before the implementation of a robotics program were compared with 100 patients treated by robotic hysterectomy after robot implementation. Overall the robotic cohort experienced longer operative times by an average of 27 minutes. The prerobotic cohort, however, when compared with the last 25 robotic cases had longer operative times (92.4 minutes [29.2], 95% CI 46.0-225.0 vs 78.7 minutes [29.5], 95% CI 66.0-91.2, p = .03). The mean blood loss in the prerobotic cohort was twice that of the robotic cohort (113 mL [85.9], 95% CI 95.9-130.1 vs 61.1 mL [60.9], 95% CI 48.9-73.2, p <.0001) and the mean length of hospital stay was half a day longer in the prerobotic cohort than in the robotic cohort (1.6 days [1.4], 95% CI 1.3-1.9 vs 1.1 days [0.7], 95% CI 1.0-1.3, p <.007). The incidence of adverse events was the same in both groups. The total number of exploratory laparotomies in the prerobotic cohort was significantly greater than in the robotic group (11% vs 0%). The rate of intraoperative conversions to total abdominal hysterectomy from laparoscopy was approximately 2-fold higher in the prerobotic cohort as compared with the robotic cohort (9% vs 4%). Conclusion: A higher likelihood of exploratory laparotomy for hysterectomy in the prerobotic cohort versus the robotic cohort and a higher likelihood of intraoperative conversion to laparotomy with the prerobotic cohort than with the robotic cohort existed. Reduced operative time, reduced blood loss, and shortened length of stay may be achieved in patients who are treated robotically versus a nonrobotic approach. Robotics may facilitate the minimally invasive treatment of patients while potentially reducing the rate of abdominal hysterectomies. © 2008 AAGL.},

   abstract = {Background Robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) lacks the haptic (kinesthetic and tactile) cues that surgeons are accustomed to receiving in open and laparoscopic surgery. We previously introduced a method for adding tactile and audio feedback of tool vibrations to RMIS systems, creating sensations similar to what one feels and hears when using a laparoscopic tool. Our prior work showed that surgeons performing box-trainer tasks signif- icantly preferred having this feedback and believed that it helped them concentrate on the task, but we did not know how well our approach would work in a clinically relevant setting. This study constituted the first in vivo test of our system. Methods Accelerometers that measure tool vibrations were mounted to the patient-side manipulators of a da Vinci S surgical system. The measured vibrations were recorded and presented to the surgeon through vibrotactile and audio channels while two transperitoneal nephrecto- mies and two mid-ureteral dissections with uretero-ureter- ostomy were completed on a porcine model. We examined 30minutes of resulting video to identify and tag manipulation events, aiming to determine whether our system can measure significant and meaningful tool vibrations during in vivo procedures. Results A total of 1,404 manipulation events were iden- tified. Analysis of each event’s accelerations indicated that 82 % of these events resulted in significant vibrations. The magnitude of the accelerations measured for different manipulation events varied widely, with hard contact causing the largest cues. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of providing tool vibration feedback during in vivo RMIS. Significant tool vibrations were reliably measured for the majority of events during standard urological procedures on a porcine model, while real-time, naturalistic tactile and audio tool vibration feedback was provided to the surgeon. The feedback system’s modules were easily implemented outside the sterile field of the da Vinci S and did not interfere with the surgical procedure.},

The aim of this study is to investigate in a prospective randomized trial the feasibility of the Nissen procedure using the da Vinci and to evaluate the benefits and the costs of this new technique compared with the conventional laparoscopic approach. Materials and methods: Twenty patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) were randomized into laparoscopic Nissen versus robot-assisted Nissen fundoplication. All the patients signed an informed consent document. The time data of the procedure, the efficacy of the instruments, the intra-operative incidents, postoperative morbidity, and cost minimization are presented. Results: Nine patients were assigned to the robot, and 11 to the laparoscopic procedure. Both groups were similar in age, male/female ratio, and body mass index. The robot procedure time was significantly longer. The hospital stay and the alimentation day were similar. The number of postoperative complaints was similar after the 1st, 6th, and 12th postoperative months. However, on the 3rd postoperative month, the number of complaints was significantly higher in the robot group. The robot procedure was more expensive with regard to the instrumentation and reusable material, the nursing costs, the investment costs, and the maintenance costs. Conclusions: No clear advantage of using robotics in the Nissen procedure was observed. The procedure seems to be feasible and safe. The technique is limited because of unadapted instruments. The disadvantages are the high costs and prolonged operative time. © 2006 by the Société Internationale de Chirurgie.},

   abstract = {Background: Several studies have shown the safety and feasibility of robot-assisted antireflux surgery but comparative data are lacking. Methods: Fifty consecutive patients scheduled for laparoscopic antireflux surgery were randomized into two groups. Twenty-five patients underwent robot-assisted surgery and 25 standard laparoscopic fundoplication. All robot-assisted procedures were performed with the da Vinci Surgical System®. Results: There were no significant differences in age, sex, body mass or preoperative reflux pattern between the groups. Operating times were significantly longer for robot-assisted than standard laparoscopic operations (mean total operating time 131.3 versus 91.1 min, P < 0.001; skin-to-skin time 78.0 versus 63.5 min, P = 0.001). There was no conversion to open surgery. Conversion to standard laparoscopy was necessary in one of 25 robot-assisted procedures. The length of hospital stay was similar in both groups. Robot-assisted surgery was associated with significantly higher mean total costs (€3157 versus €1527; P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in clinical, endoscopic and functional outcomes between groups. There was no procedure-related mortality. Conclusion: Robot-assisted laparoscopic fundoplication is comparable to the standard laparoscopic procedure in terms of feasibility and outcome, but costs are higher owing to longer operating times and the use of more expensive instruments.

   abstract = {After its debut in 1988, laparoscopic cholecystectomy rapidly became the standard of care for cholelithiasis, yet very few surgeons use minimally invasive techniques for other abdominal operations. Why do most surgeons continue to perform traditional open gastrointestinal operations? We believe that the answer to this question lies in the fact that advanced laparoscopic operations are difficult to learn, perform, and master. A number of inherent pitfalls of laparoscopy hinder the performance of these operations even after the surgeon has accumulated years of experience. These pitfalls include an unstable video camera platform, limited motion (degrees of freedom) of straight laparoscopic instruments, two-dimensional imaging, and poor ergonomics for the surgeon. Inexperienced or bored laparoscopic camera-holders move the camera frequently and rotate it away from the horizon. The long, straight laparoscopic instruments are limited in their motion by the fixation enforced by the abdominal wall trocars. Similarly, the standard two-dimensional video imaging used in most laparoscopic operations impedes the surgeon's depth perception, compounding the limitations of laparoscopic instruments. In addition, surgeons are forced to assume ergonomically awkward stances in performing many laparoscopic operations. These four factors hinder a surgeon's efforts to learn and to perform advanced laparoscopic operations, significantly lengthening the learning curve. The articles presented in this issue suggest that robotics and telerobotics offer solutions to these nagging pitfalls of laparoscopic surgery.},

   abstract = {Background: We postulated that the use of robotics may improve outcomes in hiatal hernia repair. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected Society of Thoracic Surgery database at a single institution of patients who underwent elective hiatal hernia repair from 2012 to 2017 using either laparoscopy or the da Vinci Xi robot. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes and then performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression modeling to determine the factors associated with postoperative morbidity. Results: There were 293 consecutive patients who underwent elective hiatal hernia repair using either a laparoscopic (n = 151) or a robotic (n = 142) technique. There were no significant differences in age, gender, BMI, smoking history, presence of comorbidity, or hiatal hernia type. Seventy percent of the cases were a repair of either type III or type IV hiatal hernia. There were significantly higher ASA III and IV (7.9% vs. 4.2%, P = 0.03), higher Toupet fundoplication (83.4% vs. 44.4%, P < 0.001), and lower redo-repair (7.3% vs. 20.4%, P = 0.001) in the laparoscopic group compared to the robotic group. The hospital length of stay was significantly shorter (1.3 ± 1.8 vs. 1.8 ± 1.5 days, P = 0.003) and there were significantly lower rates of complications (6.3 vs. 19.2%, P = 0.001) after robotic compared to laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair. There was no difference in readmission rate and mortality. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age and laparoscopic technique were associated with higher complications after surgery. Conclusion: The use of the Da Vinci Xi robot in our institution was associated with improved outcomes compared to laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair despite a higher incidence of re-operative cases in the robotic group. Thus, short-term outcomes of Da Vinci Xi robot-assisted hiatal hernia repair are not inferior to laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair. Further studies are needed to determine if Da Vinci Xi robot provides superior short-term and long-term outcome in treatment of symptomatic hiatal hernia.},

Two novel 3-degree-of-freedom fingertip cutaneous displays deliver a suitable amount of cutaneous feedback at the thumb and index fingers. Results assessed the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Cutaneous feedback was outperformed by full haptic feedback provided by grounded haptic interfaces, but it outperformed conditions providing no force feedback at all.

   abstract = {This paper details an experiment performed to evaluate the potential of haptic feedback to improve learning of a robotic surgery task. As Robotic Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) becomes more common, it becomes more important to properly train surgeons to use surgical robots such as the da Vinci. Because standard robotic surgery platforms do not provide touch cues, learning to use them is challenging. If haptic (tactile) feedback is provided as a training tool, we predict that trainees will learn more quickly by associating the haptic feedback with what they see. To observe this, we conducted an experiment with N = 23 novice participants from the general population of Johns Hopkins University. Participants were sorted into an experimental group, which received feedback for an extended period in the middle of the study, and a control group, which received no feedback until the very end. We hypothesized that members of the experimental group would perform better than the control group during the time that haptic feedback was administered, and that the performance improvement would remain after the feedback was removed. The results did not support the hypotheses; members of the control and experimental groups showed nearly identical learning curves.},

   abstract = {Purpose: We developed and validated a standardized assessment tool for robotic surgical skills, and report its usefulness, reliability and construct validity in a clinical setting. Materials and Methods: The Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills is a tool developed by deconstructing the fundamental elements of robotic surgical procedures in consultation with expert robotic surgeons. Surgical performance was assessed during robot-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy on a 5-point anchored Likert scale across 6 domains. An overall performance score was derived by summing the ratings in each domain. Expert surgeons and postgraduate year 4 to 6 urology residents were evaluated to determine construct validity. Assessments were completed by the attending surgeon, a trained observer and the operator. Results: A total of 29 evaluations of 25 trainees and 4 attending surgeons were completed. Experts scored significantly higher on the assessment than novice operators (p = 0.004). Postgraduate year 4 and 5 residents scored significantly lower than the expert group (p <0.05) while no difference was observed between mean performance scores of postgraduate year 6 trainees and attending surgeons (p >0.05). The internal consistency of the assessment tool was excellent (Cronbach's α = 0.90 to 0.93). The overall assessment score ICC among raters was 0.80 (95% CI 0.650.90). Conclusions: The Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills is simple to administer and able to differentiate levels of robotic surgical expertise. This standardized assessment tool shows excellent consistency, reliability and validity. Further study is warranted to evaluate its usefulness for surgical education and the establishment of competency in robotic surgery. © 2012 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.},

   abstract = {The surgical treatment of hernias has developed throughout the evolution of surgery. The fascination with hernia surgery is in part driven by its prevalence and by the variety of treatment options. Minimally invasive hernia surgery has a goal of a robust repair with minimal complications, and new robotic techniques are being developed in complex abdominal wall hernias with promising results. This review focuses on inguinal, ventral, and incisional hernias and their outcomes with a discussion on the traditional open, laparoscopic, and robotic techniques. The prevalence of minimally invasive hernia surgery and its advantages are also outlined. We highlight our experience in these procedures, specifically robotic herniorrhaphy, as it pertains to ventral incisional and inguinal hernia repair. We conclude that the robotic platform is proving to be a benefit to hernia repair. Many studies are showing its feasibility and comparable results to standard laparoscopy, and some have shown improved results, including shorter hospital stay without significant increases in cost. The robotic option of hernia repair has resulted in an increase in minimally invasive hernia repair, a number that has remained stagnant for the last decade. With more surgeons gaining training and experience and greater availability of the robotic platform, we expect to see greater numbers of minimally invasive hernia repair.},

This research identifies and explores a new construct, the surgeon’s ‘comfortable working envelope’ within the available range of motion, as a factor in surgical robotic interface design. Task accuracy and completion time for a simple aimed movement task were analysed as a function of participant hand positions obtained via infrared motion tracking. Hand positions outside the ‘comfortable working envelope’ led to a 20% increase in error magnitude. With respect to the overall input device range of motion, there were large variations in performance, up to 31% difference in error magnitude and 11% difference in movement time. These results suggest that advanced surgical robots should have intelligent re-indexing strategies. Alternatively, the robot’s control gain should adaptively change with respect to hand position to normalize a surgeon’s performance throughout his/her working volume.},

   abstract = {Background: The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved the da Vinci surgical system for all abdominal operations in July 2000. In the past 6 years, virtually all gastrointestinal operations have been accomplished using telerobotic techniques. The purpose of this review is to summarize the short-term outcomes achieved with telerobotic gastrointestinal operations. Methods: All case series of telerobotic gastrointestinal operations identified by PubMed searches are included in this review. Results: Case series document the safety and efficacy of telerobotic cholecystectomy, fundoplication, Heller myotomy, gastric bypass, colectomy, gastrectomy, and pancreatectomy. The procedures were accomplished with low rates of conversion to laparoscopic operations, mortality, and morbidity. When comparison groups were available, the analysis shows that telerobotic operations required more time than the laparoscopic operations, although for telerobotic cholecystectomy and telerobotic fundoplication, this difference disappeared in 10 to 20 operations. Specific patient advantages were not identified for telerobotic operations compared with laparoscopic operations, except for a decreased esophageal perforation rate during telerobotic Heller myotomy. Surgeons benefited from the three-dimensional imaging, the handlike motions of the robotic instruments, and an ergonomically comfortable position. Conclusion: All telerobotic gastrointestinal operations are feasible and can be performed with safety and efficacy. It is difficult to demonstrate patient-specific advantages of telerobotic surgery over laparoscopic operations. Nonetheless, telerobotic surgical systems offer distinct advantages to surgeons and may facilitate an increase in the number of surgeons performing advanced laparoscopic gastrointestinal operations. In addition, telerobotics offer a digital information platform that enables surgical simulation and augmented-reality surgery. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

The design of this study was based on Fitt's law. Statistical correlations between the index of difficulty (ID) and the movement time (MT), as well as the ID and the smoothness of the movement, were analysed.

In the haptic guidance paradigm, the subject is physically guided through the ideal motion by the haptic interface, thus giving the subject a kinesthetic understanding of what is required. Subjects learned a complex 3D motion under three training conditions (haptic, visual, haptic and visual) and were required to manually reproduce the movement under two recall conditions (with vision, without vision). Performance was measured in terms of position, shape, timing, and drift. Findings from this study indicate that haptic guidance is effective in training. While visual training was better for teaching the trajectory shape, temporal aspects of the task were more effectively learned from haptic guidance. This supports a possible role for haptics in the training of perceptual motor skills in virtual environments.},

In this study, we seek to develop a fundamental understanding of the utility of force feedback and vision in the functional operation of a body-powered upper-limb prosthesis. Using a custom body-powered prosthesis in which force feedback can be conditionally removed, we asked \{\rm N\}=10 non-amputee participants to identify objects based on stiffness in four separate conditions with and without visual and/or force feedback. Results indicate that the combination of visual and force feedback allows for the best accuracy, followed by force feedback only, then visual feedback only. In addition, combining force feedback with visual feedback does not significantly affect identification timing compared to visual feedback alone. These findings suggest that consideration should be given to the development of force feedback displays for myoelectric prostheses that function like a Bowden cable, coupling the amputee's control input to the resulting feedback.},

METHODS: Five novices (medical students) were trained in three tasks with the da Vinci Surgical System. Five experts trained in advanced laparoscopy also performed the three tasks. Time to task completion (TTC), total distance traveled (D), speed (S), curvature (kappa), and relative phase (Phi) were measured. RESULTS: Before training, TTC, D, and kappa were significantly smaller for experts than for novices (p \{<\} 0.05), whereas S was significantly larger for experts than for novices before training (p \{<\} 0.05). Novices performed significantly better after training, as shown by smaller TTC, D, and kappa, and larger S. Novice performance after training approached expert performance. CONCLUSION: This study clearly demonstrated the ability of objective kinematic measures to distinguish between novice and expert performance and training effects in the performance of robotic surgical training tasks.},

   abstract = {Background. Robotic systems are being used by an increasing number of surgeons. This environment is markedly different from that of traditional surgery and involves videoscopic guidance, remote surgical control, and the loss of haptic feedback. Defining how surgeons learn with these systems is necessary to establish training protocols for this technology. This study compared the learning curve for a robotic surgical system with that of traditional endoscopy in the performance of two standardized skill drills. Materials and methods. Twenty participants (average age 27 ± 4 years, six females) repeated two standardized endoscopic dexterity and depth perception drills for 15 repetitions with the ZEUS robotic surgical system and manual endoscopic instruments (MAN). A score combining time and precision was given for each repetition. The learning curves and overall performance with and without robotic assistance were compared. Results. For both MAN and ZEUS, improvements in performance were significantly greatest during the first five repetitions (P < 0.01, for both). Participants reached the training curve plateau faster with ZEUS than with conventional instruments (8th versus 10th for both drills). Using robotic assistance, dominant and non-dominant hand performance were statistically similar. The number of errors committed with ZEUS were significantly fewer for drill two (0.09 errors/repetition versus 0.24 errors/repetition, P = 0.002) compared to manual technique. Conclusions. This study demonstrated that training curves for conventional and robotic-assisted systems are remarkably similar. This should prove useful in the training and education of this new technology. This study further suggested that robotics may increase ambidexterity by improving non-dominant hand performance. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The purpose of this study was to show construct validity of nine new inanimate training exercises for robot-assisted surgery. The inanimate training exercises were designed to span several core technical skills required to use a robotic system. Methods: New (n = 30) and experienced (n = 11) robotic surgeons participated in the study. New robotic surgeons had not yet completed their first robotic surgery case and participated in this study before attending their robotic certification course. Experienced robotic surgeons had completed more than 200 robotic surgery cases. The raw scores from the exercises were reported so that other research groups could easily define custom proficiency levels. Example normalized scores that could be used in proficiency-based curricula were computed. These normalized scores balanced efficiency (completion time) and accuracy (exercise-specific errors) to measure performance. Finally, the setup was standardized using a custom docking model, which enabled consistent and repeatable completion of the inanimate exercises across surgeons. Results: For all nine exercises, experienced robotic surgeons completed the exercises significantly faster than new robotic surgeons (p < 0.01). Similarly, experienced robotic surgeons achieved higher normalized scores than new robotic surgeons for all nine exercises (p < 0.01). Finally, consistent robot setup was achieved using the custom docking model based on an analysis of the robot kinematic data. Conclusions: In summary, all nine inanimate exercises showed construct validity. The results suggest that the inanimate exercises along with the custom docking model can be used as part of proficiency-based curricula to improve robotic surgeon training. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.},

This allocation was made on the basis of the following criteria: the number of performed procedures, the number of robotic working days and the number of true console hours. All participants underwent a specific test to assess their ability to recognize the thickness of custom-made membranes, without the availability of haptic feedback. After the performance of the surgeons, score was given according to an appropriate evaluation system (time, preciseness, force of tension and finding a metallic object). The analysis of the performances of participants provided the following results: an average score of 8.87 for the experts compared to 3.57 of non-experts with significant difference (P < 0.05). Other parameters of interest as the average time to conduct the test showed a result of 28.8 s for experts and 71.3 s of non-experts.

   abstract = {Background: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the da Vinci robotic system using both the three-dimensional view (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) view options with traditional manually assisted laparoscopic techniques in performing standardized exercises. Methods: To evaluate surgical efficiency in the use of robotically assisted and manual laparoscopic surgery for standardized exercises six, last-year medical students without any surgical experience were selected. The exercises consisted of placing rings over receptacles, grasping a free hanging suture and cutting three pieces of it, running a suture, and performing a surgical knot. Each student performed the exercise twice. The median times needed for completion of the exercises and the median number of errors in performing the tasks were noted. Results: The unexperienced students performed the standardized tasks significantly quicker and with fewer errors when assisted by the da Vinci robot in the 3D optical display mode, as compared with traditional manually assisted laparoscopic surgery. Even when the 2D mode was selected, a significant advantage favoring the da Vinci robotic system was seen both in time and efficacy for most exercises. When the 3D and 2D modes were compared, time differences in favor of the 3D mode remained, but a significant difference in efficacy favoring the 3D mode was seen only in one exercise (exercise 2: suture cutting). Conclusions: The da Vinci robotic system permits standardized minimal invasive surgical exercises to be performed quicker and more efficiently than traditional minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, with the aid of this robotic system, difficult laparoscopic interventions may become easier to perform, and indications for minimal invasive surgery may be expanded.},

   abstract = {Background and aims: Laparoscopic surgery has become the treatment of choice for cholecystectomy. Many studies showed that while this approach benefits the patient, the surgeon faces such distinct disadvantages as a poor ergonomic situation and limited degrees of freedom with limited motion as a consequence. Robots have the potential to overcome these problems. To evaluate the efficiency and feasibility of robotically assisted surgery (RAC), we designed a prospective study to compare it with standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SLC). Materials and methods: Between 2001 and 2003, 26 patients underwent SLC and 20 patients underwent RAC using the ZEUS system. The feasibility, safety, and possible advantages were evaluated. To assess the efficacy, the total time in the operating room was divided into preoperative, operative, and postoperative time frames. For RAC in comparison with SLC, the preoperative phase including equipment setup was significantly longer. In the intraoperative phase, the cut-closure time and camera and trocar insertion times were significantly longer. It is interesting to note that the net dissection time for the cystic artery, duct, and the gall bladder was not different from SLC. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the feasibility of robotically assisted cholecystectomy without system-specific morbidity. There is time loss in several phases of robotic surgery due to equipment setup and deinstallation and therefore, presents no benefit in using the robot in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. © Springer-Verlag 2006.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Robotic laparoscopic surgery is postulated to result in better surgical results by allowing improved instrument manipulation and three-dimensional vision. The authors' experience performing robot-assisted laparoscopic colorectal surgery is reported. METHOD: Standard laparoscopic procedures with robot-assisted laparoscopic colon mobilization and vascular ligation were performed. Data relating to the operative procedure, hospital stay, and direct costs were collected. Results were compared with age, gender, and procedure case-matched controls taken from a prospective laparoscopic colorectal surgery database. RESULTS: Six robot-assisted laparoscopic surgeries (2 right hemicolectomies, 3 sigmoid colectomies, and 1 Wells rectopexy) were performed between December 2001 and June 2002. There was no associated morbidity. Operative time was increased from a median time of 108 minutes for standard laparoscopic colorectal surgery to 165 minutes for robot-assisted laparoscopic surgeries (P = 0.0313; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test for non-parametric data). This was primarily a result of the time required for robot set-up. Blood loss, length of stay, and hospital cost were not significantly different between groups. Additional direct equipment costs for RAC cases included robotic laparoscopic instruments and sterile drapes (approximately US $350 per case), without including acquisition and maintenance costs for the robot. CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted laparoscopic colectomy is a feasible and safe procedure. Although three-dimensional vision and dexterity are facilitated, operative time is increased and the overall additional expense of robotics is of concern. Robot-assisted laparoscopic colectomy requires further evaluation to establish clinical and financial benefits before introduction to routine practice. Such techniques may, in the future, facilitate complex laparoscopic techniques.},

In this paper, we study the difference between applied suture forces in three knot tying exercises: hand ties, instrument ties (using needle drivers), and robot ties (using the da Vinci™ Surgical System from Intuitive Surgical, Inc.). Both instrument and robot-assisted ties differ from hand ties in accuracy of applied force. However, only the robot ties differ from hand ties in repeatability of applied force. Furthermore, comparison between attendings and residents revealed statistically significant differences in the forces used during hand ties, although attendings and residents perform similarly when comparing instrument and robot ties to hand ties. These results indicate that resolved force feedback would improve robot-assisted performance during complex surgical tasks such as knot tying with fine suture.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are few population-based data describing outcomes of robotic-assisted surgery. We compared outcomes of robotic-assisted, laparoscopic, and open surgery in a nationally representative population database. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from October 2008 to December 2009 was performed. We identified the most common robotic procedures by ICD-9 procedure codes and grouped them into categories by procedure type. Multivariate analyses examined mortality, length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charges, adjusting for age, race, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, and teaching hospital status. RESULTS: A total of 368,239 patients were identified. On adjusted analysis, compared with open, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery was associated with decreased odds of mortality (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.2; p < 0.001), decreased mean LOS (-2.4 days; 95% CI, -2.5 to 2.3; p < 0.001), and increased mean total charges in all procedures (range $3,852 to $15,329) except coronary artery bypass grafting (-$17,318; 95% CI, -34,492 to -143; p = 0.048) and valvuloplasty (not statistically significant). Compared with laparoscopic, robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery was associated with decreased odds of mortality (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.6; p = 0.008), decreased LOS overall (-0.6 days; 95% CI, -0.7 to -0.5; p < 0.001), but increased LOS in prostatectomy and other kidney/bladder procedures (0.3 days; 95% CI, 0.1-0.4; p = 0.006; 0.8 days; 95% CI, 0.0-1.6; p = 0.049), and increased total charges ($1,309; 95% CI, 519-2,099; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that, compared with open surgery, robotic-assisted surgery results in decreased LOS and diminished likelihood of death. However, these benefits are not as apparent when comparing robotic-assisted laparoscopic with nonrobotic laparoscopic procedures. © 2012 American College of Surgeons.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the outcomes of 500 robotically assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALPs), a minimally invasive alternative for treating prostate cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 500 patients had RALP over a 30-month period. A transperitoneal six-port approach was used in each case, with the da Vinci robotic surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Prospective data collection included quality-of-life questionnaires, basic demographics (height, weight and body mass index), prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels, clinical stage and Gleason grade. Variables assessed during RALP were operative duration, estimated blood loss (EBL) and complications, and after RALP were hospital stay, catheter time, pathology, PSA level, return of continence and potency. RESULTS: The mean (range) duration of RALP was 130 (51-330) min; all procedures were successful, with no intraoperative transfusions or deaths. The mean EBL was 10-300 mL; 97% of patients were discharged home on the first day after RALP with a mean haematocrit of 36%. The mean duration of catheterization was 6.9 (5-21) days. The positive margin rate was 9.4% for all patients; i.e. 2.5% for T2 tumours, 23% for T3a and 53% for T4. The overall biochemical recurrence free (PSA level <0.1 ng/mL) survival was 95% at mean follow-up of 9.7 months. There was complete continence at 3 and 6 months in 89% and 95% of patients, respectively. At 1 year 78% of patients were potent (with or without the use of oral medications), 15% were not yet able to sustain erections capable of intercourse, and another 7% still required injection therapy. CONCLUSION: RALP is a safe, feasible and minimally invasive alternative for treating prostate cancer. Our initial experience with the procedure shows promising short-term outcomes. © 2007 BJU International.},

Simulation programs have been tested and validated for laparotomy and for laparoscopy, but there is not yet a validated program specific for robotic surgery. Due to substantial advances in this new technology, we have developed a program in Nancy dedicated to outside-the-operating room (OR) teaching of robotic surgery using the Da Vinci robot. This teaching is based on a combined program of theoretical teaching (e-learning) and learning of practical skills using virtual simulators (DV-Trainer®, Robotic Mentor®, DVSS®), mechanical simulators (Dome, Applied® abdominal simulators), microsurgery and wet lab using ex vivo animal organs, anesthetized animals, and cadavers. This program also emphasizes team training. The course is intended for residents in surgical training and is integrated into the specialized study diploma (DES) program for Visceral and Digestive Surgery; it also can be used by qualified surgeons who can integrate it with the Inter-University Diploma (DIU) in General Robotic Surgery for basic techniques and also for DIUs in other surgical specialties (digestive and gynecologic surgery) for robotic uses within their specialty. These courses are based on the concept of step-by-step skills acquisition and verification allowing a transition to safe clinical activity.},

AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a "savvy" prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective.

   abstract = {Background: As surgical robots begin to occupy a larger place in operating rooms around the world, continued innovation is necessary to improve our outcomes. Methods A comprehensive review of current surgical robotic user interfaces was performed to describe the modern surgical platforms, identify the benefits, and address the issues of feedback and limitations of visualization. Results: Most robots currently used in surgery employ a master/slave relationship, with the surgeon seated at a work-console, manipulating the master system and visualizing the operation on a video screen. Although enormous strides have been made to advance current technology to the point of clinical use, limitations still exist. A lack of haptic feedback to the surgeon and the inability of the surgeon to be stationed at the operating table are the most notable examples. The future of robotic surgery sees a marked increase in the visualization technologies used in the operating room, as well as in the robots' abilities to convey haptic feedback to the surgeon. This will allow unparalleled sensation for the surgeon and almost eliminate inadvertent tissue contact and injury. Conclusions: A novel design for a user interface will allow the surgeon to have access to the patient bedside, remaining sterile throughout the procedure, employ a headmounted three-dimensional visualization system, and allow the most intuitive master manipulation of the slave robot to date. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.},

In order to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique, we carried out a bimanual teleoperation experiment, similar to the da Vinci Skills Simulator’s Pegboard task. We compared the performance of our sensory subtraction approach with that of (1) complete haptic feedback and (2) auditory feedback in substitution of force feedback.

   abstract = {Background Function-preserving minimally invasive pancreatectomy is thought to be an ideal approach for pancreatic benign and borderline malignant lesions requiring pancreatectomy. However, it is not that easy to accomplish this goal with the conventional laparoscopic approach. It requires extensive surgeon experience and learned techniques. A robot surgical system was recently introduced to overcome these limitations and it may potentially provide precise and safe laparoscopic surgery. Methods Between March 2006 and July 2010, a total of 45 patients underwent laparoscopic or robot-assisted pancreatectomy performed by a single pancreatic surgeon to preserve the spleen. Twenty-five patients underwent the conventional laparoscopic approach (Lap group) and the other 20 patients underwent robot-assisted surgery (Robot group). The perioperative clinicopathologic variables (age, gender, length of resected pancreas, tumor size, tumor location, amount of bleeding, operation time, length of hospital stay, complications, mortality, and cost) were compared between the two groups, as well as the spleen preservation rate. Results Younger patients preferred robot-assisted surgery to conventional laparoscopic surgery (44.5 ± 15.9 vs. 56.7 ± 13.9 years, p = 0.010), and the mean operation time was longer in the Robot group (258.2 ± 118.6 vs. 348.7 ± 121.8 min, p = 0.016). The spleen-preserving rate of the Robot group was considerably superior to that of the Lap group (fail/success, 9/16 vs. 1/19, p = 0.027). However, robot surgery cost the patients about USD 8,300 (USD 8,304.8 ± 870.0), which was more than twice the amount for the Lap group (USD 3,861.7 ± 1,724.3). There were no significant differences in other clinicopathologic variables. Conclusion Robot-assisted pancreatic surgery could provide an increased chance for spleen preservation in spite of higher cost and longer operation time.

Study Design: Pooled Data from Independent Prospective Clinical Trials. Methods: One hundred ninety-two patients were initially screened, but inadequate exposure did not permit TORS in 13 (6.7%). For two additional patients, TORS was begun but intraoperatively converted to an open procedure. Thus, the intent-to-treat population was 177 patients (average age, 59 years; 81% male), predominantly comprised of tumors arising in the oropharynx (139, 78%) and larynx (26, 15%). TORS was performed for 161 (91%) patients with malignant disease: 153 (95%) with squamous cell carcinoma (T1 [50, 32.7%], T2 [74, 48.4%], T3 [21, 13.7%], T4 [8, 5.2%]), six patients (3.72%) with salivary gland tumors, and two patients with carcinoma in situ. The average follow-up was 345 days. Results: There was no intraoperative mortality or death in the immediate postoperative period. Average estimated blood loss was 83 mL; no patient required transfusion. The rate of positive margins was 4.3%. Twenty-nine patients (16%) experienced 34 serious adverse events that required hospitalization or intervention (grade 3) or were considered life threatening (grade 4, 2.3%). Tracheostomy was performed in 12.4% of all patients (22/177), but only 2.3% had a tracheostomy at last follow-up. For all patients undergoing TORS without previous therapy, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy dependency rate was 5.0%. The average hospital stay was 4.2 days. Conclusions: Based on this multicenter study, TORS appears to be safe, feasible, and as such play an important role in the multidisciplinary management of head and neck cancer. © 2012 The American Laryngological, Rhinological, and Otological Society, Inc.},

METHODS This systematic review focused on the published literature that used randomized controlled trials to examine the effectiveness of simulation-based training to develop laparoscopic surgery skills. Searching PubMed from the inception of the databases to May 1, 2014 and specific hand journal searches identified the studies. This current review of the literature addresses the question of whether laparoscopic simulation translates the acquisition of surgical skills to the operating room (OR). RESULTS This systematic review of simulation-based training and laparoscopic surgery found that specific skills could be translatable to the OR. Twenty-one studies reported learning outcomes measured in five behavioral categories: economy of movement (8 studies); suturing (3 studies); performance time (13 studies); error rates (7 studies), and global rating (7 studies). CONCLUSION Simulation-based training can lead to demonstrable benefits of surgical skills in the OR environment. This review suggests that simulation-based training is an effective way to teach laparoscopic surgery skills, increase translation of laparoscopic surgery skills to the OR, and increase patient safety; however, more research should be conducted to determine if and how simulation can become apart of surgical curriculum.},

   abstract = {Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) holds great promise for improving the accuracy and dexterity of a surgeon while minimizing trauma to the patient. However, widespread clinical success with RMIS has been marginal and it is hypothesized by engineers and surgeons alike that the lack of haptic feedback presented to the surgeon is a limiting factor. The objective of our research is to acquire, display, and determine the utility of haptic information during RMIS. This overview paper examines the design, analysis, practicality, and effectiveness of various force estimation and display methods. In particular, we describe our experience in adding force feedback to an experimental version of the da Vinci surgical system, a commercially available teleoperated RMIS system. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Background: The open approach continues to be widely performed for ventral hernia repair, while the minimally invasive laparoscopic approach has grown adoption over the last decade. Recently, robotic operation was described as a new modality due to the ease for performing intracorporeal closure of the hernia defect. This study is one of the first multi-institutional case series evaluating robotic-assisted laparoscopic ventral hernia repairs, with the goal of describing robotic-assisted surgical techniques for ventral and incisional hernia repair and the outcomes in teaching and community hospital settings. Methods: Medical records of consecutive patients (including surgeon’s learning curve cases) who underwent ventral or incisional hernia repair utilizing the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale CA) were retrospectively reviewed. Data collected included preoperative history and perioperative outcomes. Results: Data for a total of 368 patients from four institutions involving five surgeons were analyzed. They were predominantly females (60.3 %), and the mean age was 51 years. The majority of the patients were obese or morbidly obese (47.8 and 20.9 %), and 83.2 % of the patients had a history of prior abdominal operation. Conversion rate was 0.8 %, and mean length of stay was 1 day. Total postoperative complications rate up to 30 days was 8.4 %, of which incidence of paralytic ileus was 2.4 %. Conclusion: This large case series of 368 patients demonstrates reproducibility of safety and performance associated with robotic-assisted ventral hernia repairs performed by five surgeons at four institutions. In addition, the results of short term perioperative outcomes for surgeons during their early experience for robotic-assisted cases are in the range of what is reported in the existing published data on laparoscopic and open ventral hernia repairs. Further comparative evidence initiatives are being pursued to determine the benefits of robotic-assisted technique and technology for long-term and patient-reported outcomes.},

   abstract = {Background: Laparoscopic minimally invasive surgery has revolutionized surgical care by reducing trauma to the patient, thereby decreasing the need for medication and shortening recovery times. During open procedures, surgeons can directly feel tissue characteristics. However, in laparoscopic surgery, tactile feedback during grip is attenuated and limited to the resistance felt in the tool handle. Excessive grip force during laparoscopic surgery can lead to tissue damage. Providing additional supplementary tactile feedback may allow subjects to have better control of grip force and identification of tissue characteristics, potentially decreasing the learning curve associated with complex minimally invasive techniques. Methods: A tactile feedback system has been developed and integrated into a modified laparoscopic grasper that allows forces applied at the grasper tips to be felt by the surgeon's hands. In this study, 15 subjects (11 novices, 4 experts) were asked to perform single-handed peg transfers using these laparoscopic graspers in three trials (feedback OFF, ON, OFF). Peak and average grip forces (newtons) during each grip event were measured and compared using a Wilcoxon ranked test in which each subject served as his or her own control. Results: After activating the tactile feedback system, the novice subject population showed significant decreases in grip force (p < 0.003). When the system was deactivated for the third trial, there were significant increases in grip force (p < 0.003). Expert subjects showed no significant improvements with the addition of tactile feedback (p > 0.05 in all cases). Conclusion: Supplementary tactile feedback helped novice subjects reduce grip force during the laparoscopic training task but did not offer improvements for the four expert subjects. This indicates that tactile feedback may be beneficial for laparoscopic training but has limited long-term use in the nonrobotic setting. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In addition, conventional interventional surgical robotic systems typically employ a master–slave architecture with an open-loop force feedback, which results in inaccurate control. We develop herein a novel real-time master–slave (RTMS) interventional surgical robotic system with a closed-loop force feedback that allows a surgeon to sense the true force during remote operation, provide adequate haptic feedback, and improve control accuracy in robot-assisted catheterization. As part of this system, we also design a unique master control handle that measures the true force felt by a surgeon, providing the basis for the closed-loop control of the entire system. We use theoretical and empirical methods to demonstrate that the proposed RTMS system provides a surgeon (using the master control handle) with a more accurate and realistic force sensation, which subsequently improves the precision of the master–slave manipulation. The experimental results show a substantial increase in the control accuracy of the force feedback and an increase in operational efficiency during surgery.},

In this report, different methods for feedback of such information to the surgeon are discussed. It is hypothesized that various methods of contact feedback have the potential to enhance performance in a robot-assisted minimally invasive environment. To verify the hypothesis, novel mechanisms needed for incorporating contact feedback were designed, including a surgeon-robot interface with full force feedback capabilities and a surgical end-effector with full force sensing capabilities, that are suitable for minimally invasive applications. These two mechanisms were used to form a robotic "master-slave" test bed for studying the effect of contact feedback on the system and user performance. Using the master-slave system, experiments for surgical tasks involving soft tissue palpation were conducted. The performance of the master-slave system was validated in terms of criteria that assess the accurate transmission of task-related information to the surgeon, which is critical in the context of soft tissue surgical applications. Moreover, using a set of experiments involving human subjects, the performance of several users in carrying out the task was compared among different methods of contact feedback. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},

This paper presents the use of neural networks to estimate the inverse dynamics of the da Vinci surgical robot, which enables estimation of the external environment forces. Experiments with motions in free space demonstrate that the neural networks can estimate the internal joint torques within 10% normalized rootmean-square error (NRMSE), which outperforms model-based approaches in the literature. Comparison with an external force sensor shows that the method is able to estimate environment forces within about 10% NRMSE.},

   abstract = {The impact of haptic feedback on the perception of unknown objects (10 without texture, 10 with texture, and 2 complex shapes) was examined. Using a point probe (a PHANTOM), three treatment groups of students (visual, haptic, and visual plus haptic feedback) explored a set of virtual objects. The visual treatment group observed the objects through a small circular aperture. Accuracy of perception, exploration time, and description of objects were compared for the three treatment groups. Participants included 45 visually normal undergraduate students distributed across the three treatment groups and 4 blind students composing a second haptic- only group. Results showed that, within the normally sighted students, the haptic and haptic plus visual groups were slightly slower in their explorations than the visual group. The haptic plus visual group was more accurate in identifying objects than the visual or haptic-only groups. The terms used by the haptic treatment group to describe the objects differed from the visual and visual plus haptic groups, suggesting that these modalities are processed differently. There were no differences across the three groups for long-term memory of the objects. The haptic group was significantly more accurate in identifying the complex objects than the visual or visual plus haptic groups. The blind students using haptic feedback were not significantly different from the other haptic-only treatment group of normally-sighted participants for accuracy, exploration pathways, and exploration times. The haptic-only group of participants spent more time exploring the back half of the virtual objects than the visual or visual plus haptic participants. This finding supports previous research showing that the use of the PHANTOM with haptic feedback tends to support the development of 3-dimensional understandings of objects.},

Visual dominance appears to be related to the relatively weak capacity of visual inputs to alert the organism to their occurrence. In response to this reduced alerting, Ss tend to keep their attention tuned to the visual modality. This bias works via prior entry to allow vision to control the mechanisms that subserve conscious reports. Recent empirical data are presented, and it is concluded that the study of visual dominance provides a model situation in which chronometric and phenomenological techniques can be brought together to produce a more complete picture of the relation between information processing and awareness.

   abstract = {Background: It has long been known that a concomitantly cooled stimulus is perceived as heavier than the same object at a neutral temperature-termed Weber's Phenomenon (WP). In the current study, we re-examined this phenomenon using well-controlled force and temperature stimuli to explore the complex interplay between thermal and tactile systems, and the peripheral substrates contributing to these interactions. A feedback-controlled apparatus was constructed using a mechanical stimulator attached to a 5- × 5-mm thermode. Force combinations of 0.5 and 1 N (superimposed on 1-N step) were applied to the ulnar territory of dorsal hand. One of the forces had a thermal component, being cooled from 32 to 28 °C at a rate of 2 °C/s with a 3-s static phase. The other stimulus was thermally neutral (32 °C). Participants were asked to report whether the first or the second stimulus was perceived heavier. These observations were obtained in the all-fibre-intact condition and following the preferential block of myelinated fibres by compression of ulnar nerve. Results: In normal condition, when the same forces were applied, all subjects displayed a clear preference for the cooled tactile stimulus as being heavier than the tactile-only stimulus. The frequency of this effect was augmented by an additional ~17% when cooling was applied concurrently with the second stimulus. Following compression block, the mean incidence of WP was significantly reduced regardless of whether cooling was applied concurrently with the first or the second stimulus. However, while the effect was abolished in case of former (elicited in <50% of trials), the compression block had little effect in four out of nine participants in case of latter who reported WP in at least 80% of trials (despite abolition of vibration and cold sensations). Conclusions: WP was found to be a robust tactile-thermal interaction in the all-fibre-intact condition. The emergence of inter-individual differences during myelinated block suggests that subjects may adopt strategies, unbeknownst to them, that focus on the dominant input (myelinated fibres, hence WP abolished by block) or the sum of convergent inputs (myelinated and C fibres, hence WP preserved during block) in order to determine differences in perceived heaviness.},

These patterns were simulated in Experiments 4-6 with objects of fixed mass, volume, and visible size. Perceived heaviness decreased and increased, respectively, over object sets with the eigenvalue patterns of (a) constant mass, increasing volume and (b) increasing mass, constant volume.

Little is known about how these interactions are perceived, although it becomes crucial for the nascent industry of interactive displays with haptic feedback (e.g. smartphones and tablets) where tactile feedback based on friction modulation is particularly relevant. To investigate the human perception of frictional strains, we mounted a high-fidelity friction modulating ultrasonic device on a robotic platform performing controlled rubbing of the fingertip and asked participants to detect induced decreases of friction during a forced-choice task. The ability to perceive the changes in friction was found to follow Weber's Law of just noticeable differences, as it consistently depended on the ratio between the reduction in tangential force and the pre-stimulation tangential force. The Weber fraction was 0.11 in all conditions demonstrating a very high sensitivity to transient changes in friction. Humid fingers experienced less friction reduction than drier ones for the same intensity of ultrasonic vibration but the Weber fraction for detecting changes in friction was not influenced by the humidity of the skin.},

This promise is often evaluated in experiments involving non-amputees, though the availability of additional haptic feedback from an intact hand (auxiliary feedback) may confound attempts to use non-amputees as stand-ins for amputees. In this paper we test the influence of auxiliary haptic feedback on myoelectric control performance by introducing various grasp conditions in a compensatory tracking task. We ask non-amputees to compensate for the motion of a random signal by producing myoelectric control signals with a hard object, soft object, or no object (requiring co-contraction) in their grasp. The error signal is displayed through a squeeze band worn about the upper arm or a visual display. Our results suggest that the main difference between tracking with haptic and visual feedback is low-frequency drift, and that auxiliary feedback does not substantially influence task performance. Despite the drift, our results show that participants are able to respond to cues presented through the squeeze band in the compensatory tracking task.},

Results for the typically developed group confirmed Weber’s law, demonstrating a linear increase in JNDs with intensity, resulting in constant fractions across intensities. The results for the ASD, in contrast, showed no scaling of JNDs with intensity; instead, fractions decreased linearly with intensity. In striking contrast to its consistency in typical perception, Weber’s law does not hold for visual and haptic perception in autism.

   abstract = {Detecting and measuring emotional responses while interacting with virtual reality (VR), and assessing and interpreting their impacts on human engagement and ‘‘immersion,’’ are both academically and technologically challenging. While many researchers have, in the past, focused on the affective evaluation of passive environments, such as listening to music or the observation of videos and imagery, virtual realities and related interactive environments have been used in only a small number of research studies as a mean of presenting emotional stimuli. This article reports the first stage (focusing on participants’ subjective responses) of a range of experimental investigations supporting the evaluation of emotional responses within a virtual environment, according to a three-dimensional (Valence, Arousal, and Dominance) model of affects, developed in the 1970s and 1980s. To populate this three-dimensional model with participants’ emotional responses, an ‘‘affective VR,’’ capable of manipulating users’ emotions, has been designed and subjectively evaluated. The VR takes the form of a dynamic ‘‘speedboat’’ simulation, elements (controllable VR parameters) of which were assessed and selected based on a 35-respondent online survey, coupled with the implementation of an affective power approximation algorithm. A further 68 participants took part in a series of trials, interacting with a number of VR variations, while subjectively rating their emotional responses. The experimental results provide an early level of confidence that this particular affective VR is capable of manipulating individuals’ emotional experiences, through the control of its internal parameters. Moreover, the approximation technique proved to be fairly reliable in predicting users’ potential emotional responses, in various affective VR settings, prior to actual experiences. Finally, the analysis suggested that the emotional response of the users, with different gender and gaming experiences, could vary, when presented with the same affective VR situation.},

   abstract = {When faced with a novel object, we explore it to understand its shape. This way we combine information coming from different senses, as touch, proprioception and vision, together with the motor information embedded in our motor execution plan. The exploration process provides a structure and constrains this rich flow of inputs, supporting the formation of a unified percept and the memorization of the object features. However, how the exploration strategies are planned is still an open question. In particular, is the exploration strategy used to memorize an object different from the exploration strategy adopted in a recall task? To address this question we used iCube, a sensorized cube which measures its orientation in space and the location of the contacts on its faces. Participants were required to explore the cube faces where little pins were positioned in varying number. Participants had to explore the cube twice and individuate potential differences between the two presentations, which could be performed either haptically alone, or with also vision available. The haptic and visuo-haptic exploratory strategies changed significantly when finalized to memorize the structure of the object with respect to when the same object was explored to recall and compare it with its memorized instance. These findings indicate that exploratory strategies are finely tuned not only to the property of the object to be analyzed, but also to the prospective use of the resulting representation, be it memorization or recall. The results are discussed in light of the possibility of a systematic modeling of natural visuo-haptic exploration strategies.},

   abstract = {Background: Virtual reality (VR) as surgical training tool has become a state-of-the-art technique in training and teaching skills for minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Although intuitively appealing, the true benefits of haptic (VR training) platforms are unknown. Many questions about haptic feedback in the different areas of surgical skills (training) need to be answered before adding costly haptic feedback in VR simulation for MIS training. This study was designed to review the current status and value of haptic feedback in conventional and robot-assisted MIS and training by using virtual reality simulation. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was undertaken using PubMed and MEDLINE. The following search terms were used: Haptic feedback OR Haptics OR Force feedback AND/OR Minimal Invasive Surgery AND/ OR Minimal Access Surgery AND/OR Robotics AND/OR Robotic Surgery AND/OR Endoscopic Surgery AND/OR Virtual Reality AND/OR Simulation OR Surgical Training/ Education. Results: The results were assessed according to level of evidence as reflected by the Oxford Centre of Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Conclusions: In the current literature, no firm consensus exists on the importance of haptic feedback in performing minimally invasive surgery. Although the majority of the results show positive assessment of the benefits of force feedback, results are ambivalent and not unanimous on the subject. Benefits are least disputed when related to surgery using robotics, because there is no haptic feedback in currently used robotics. The addition of haptics is believed to reduce surgical errors resulting from a lack of it, especially in knot tying. Little research has been performed in the area of robot-assisted endoscopic surgical training, but results seem promising. Concerning VR training, results indicate that haptic feedback is important during the early phase of psychomotor skill acquisition. © The Author(s) 2008.},

   abstract = {Objective: Two experiments were conducted to examine the effects of vision and masking friction on contact perception and compliance differentiation thresholds in a simulated tissue-probing task. Background: In minimally invasive surgery, the surgeon receives limited haptic feedback because of the current design of the instrumentation and relies on visual feedback to judge the amount of force applied to the tissues. It is suggested that friction forces inherent in the instruments contribute to errors in surgeons' haptic perception. This paper investigated the psychophysics of contact detection and cross-modal sensory processing in the context of minimally invasive surgery. Method: A within-subjects repeated measures design was used, with friction, vision, tissue softness, and order of presentation as independent factors, and applied force, detection time, error, and confidence as dependent measures. Eight participants took part in each experiment, with data recorded by a custom force-sensing system. Results: In both detection and differentiation tasks, higher thresholds, longer detection times, and more errors were observed when vision was not available. The effect was more pronounced when haptic feedback was masked by friction forces in the surgical device (p < .05). Conclusion: Visual and haptic feedback were equally important for tissue compliance differentiation. Application: A frictionless endoscopic instrument can be designed to restore critical haptic information to surgeons without having to create haptic feedback artificially.

This has been demonstrated during fatigue, after partial curarization, and when the biomechanical properties of the limb have been changed. There is also experimental support for the proposition that muscular afferent discharges contribute to the perception of force. Judgments of weight are also shown to be influenced by variables such as volume and density. The effects of volume on perceived heaviness are addressed in the context of the size-weight illusion.

Wearable haptic devices, such as vibrotactile sleeves or armbands, can provide haptic feedback in a smaller and more lightweight form factor than haptic gloves that can be bulky and cumbersome to the wearer. In this article, we present tactile and squeeze bracelet interface (Tasbi), a multimodal haptic wristband that can provide radial squeeze forces around the wrist along with vibrotactile feedback at six discrete locations around the band. Tasbi implements a squeezing mechanism that minimizes tangential forces between the band's points of contact with the skin, instead of focusing the motor actuation to predominantly normal forces. Force sensing capacitors enable closed-loop control of the squeeze force, while vibration is achieved with linear resonant actuators. A detailed description of the design and experimental results demonstrating closed-loop control of squeeze cues provided by Tasbi is presented. Additionally, we present the results of psychophysical experiments that quantify user perception of the vibration and squeeze cues, including vibrotactile identification accuracy in the presence of varying squeeze forces, discrimination thresholds for the squeeze force, and an analysis of user preferences for squeeze actuation magnitudes.},

Incorporating touch cues into robotic surgery training could potentially shorten this learning process if the benefits of haptic feedback were sustained after it is removed. In this paper, we develop a wrist-squeezing haptic feedback system and evaluate whether it holds the potential to train novice da Vinci users to reduce the force they exert on a bimanual inanimate training task. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups according to a multiple baseline experimental design. Each of the ten participants moved a ring along a curved wire nine times while the haptic feedback was conditionally withheld, provided, and withheld again. The realtime tactile feedback of applied force magnitude significantly reduced the integral of the force produced by the da Vinci tools on the task materials, and this result remained even when the haptic feedback was removed. Overall, our findings suggest that wrist-squeezing force feedback can play an essential role in helping novice trainees learn to minimize the force they exert with a surgical robot.},

   abstract = {When we hold an object while looking at it, estimates from visual and haptic cues to size are combined in a statistically optimal fashion, whereby the "weight" given to each signal reflects their relative reliabilities. This allows object properties to be estimated more precisely than would otherwise be possible. Tools such as pliers and tongs systematically perturb the mapping between object size and the hand opening. This could complicate visual-haptic integration because it may alter the reliability of the haptic signal, thereby disrupting the determination of appropriate signal weights. To investigate this we first measured the reliability of haptic size estimates made with virtual pliers-like tools (created using a stereoscopic display and force-feedback robots) with different "gains" between hand opening and object size. Haptic reliability in tool use was straightforwardly determined by a combination of sensitivity to changes in hand opening and the effects of tool geometry. The precise pattern of sensitivity to hand opening, which violated Weber's law, meant that haptic reliability changed with tool gain. We then examined whether the visuo-motor system accounts for these reliability changes. We measured the weight given to visual and haptic stimuli when both were available, again with different tool gains, by measuring the perceived size of stimuli in which visual and haptic sizes were varied independently. The weight given to each sensory cue changed with tool gain in a manner that closely resembled the predictions of optimal sensory integration. The results are consistent with the idea that different tool geometries are modeled by the brain, allowing it to calculate not only the distal properties of objects felt with tools, but also the certainty with which those properties are known. These findings highlight the flexibility of human sensory integration and tool-use, and potentially provide an approach for optimizing the design of visual-haptic devices. © 2014 Takahashi and Watt.},

   abstract = {The increasing ubiquity of haptic displays (e.g., smart phones and tablets) necessitates a better understanding of the perceptual capabilities of the human haptic system. Haptic displays will soon be capable of locally deforming to create simple 3D shapes. This study investigated the sensitivity of our haptic system to a fundamental component of shapes: edges. A novel set of eight high quality shape stimuli with test edges that varied in sharpness were fabricated in a 3D printer. In a two alternative, forced choice task, blindfolded participants were presented with two of these shapes side by side (one the reference, the other selected randomly from the remaining set of seven) and after actively exploring the test edge of each shape with the tip of their index finger, reported which shape had the sharper edge. We used a model selection approach to fit optimal psychometric functions to performance data, and from these obtained just noticeable differences and Weber fractions. In Experiment 1, participants performed the task with four different references. With sharpness defined as the angle at which one surface meets the horizontal plane, the four JNDs closely followed Weber's Law, giving a Weber fraction of 0.11. Comparisons to previously reported Weber fractions from other haptic manipulations (e.g. amplitude of vibration) suggests we are sufficiently sensitive to changes in edge sharpness for this to be of potential utility in the design of future haptic displays. In Experiment 2, two groups of participants performed the task with a single reference but different exploration strategies; one was limited to a single touch, the other unconstrained and free to explore as they wished. As predicted, the JND in the free exploration condition was lower than that in the single touch condition, indicating exploration strategy affects sensitivity to edge sharpness. © 2013 Skinner et al.},

Diffusion models have been proposed to capture the increase in response time for more uncertain decisions and the change in performance due to a prioritization of speed or accuracy in the responses. Experimental paradigms have been confined to the visual modality and model analysis have mostly used quantile-probability (QP) plots-response probability as a function of quantized RTs. Here, we extend diffusion modeling to haptics and test a novel type of analysis for judging model fitting. Participants classified force stimuli applied to the hand as "high" or "low." Data in QP plots indicate that the diffusion model captures well the overall pattern of responses in conditions where either speed or accuracy has been prioritized. To further the analysis, we compute just noticeable difference (JND) values separately for responses delivered with different RTs-we define these plots as JND quantile. The pattern of results evidences that slower responses lead to better force discrimination up to a plateau that is unaffected by prioritization instructions. Instead, the diffusion model predicts two well-separated plateaus depending on the condition. We propose that analyzing the relation between JNDs and response time should be considered in the evaluation of the diffusion model beyond the haptic modality, thus including vision.},

   abstract = {When lifting an object, the brain uses visual cues and an internal object representation to predict its weight and scale fingertip forces accordingly. Once available, tactile information is rapidly integrated to update the weight prediction and refine the internal object representation. If visual cues cannot be used to predict weight, force planning relies on implicit knowledge acquired from recent lifting experience, termed sensorimotor memory. Here, we investigated whether perception of weight is similarly biased according to previous lifting experience and how this is related to force scaling. Participants grasped and lifted series of light or heavy objects in a semi-randomized order and estimated their weights. As expected, we found that forces were scaled based on previous lifts (sensorimotor memory) and these effects increased depending on the length of recent lifting experience. Importantly, perceptual weight estimates were also influenced by the preceding lift, resulting in lower estimations after a heavy lift compared to a light one. In addition, weight estimations were negatively correlated with the magnitude of planned force parameters. This perceptual bias was only found if the current lift was light, but not heavy since the magnitude of sensorimotor memory effects had, according to Weber’s law, relatively less impact on heavy compared to light objects. A control experiment tested the importance of active lifting in mediating these perceptual changes and showed that when weights are passively applied on the hand, no effect of previous sensory experience is found on perception. These results highlight how fast learning of novel object lifting dynamics can shape weight perception and demonstrate a tight link between action planning and perception control. If predictive force scaling and actual object weight do not match, the online motor corrections, rapidly implemented to downscale forces, will also downscale weight estimation in a proportional manner.},

In this paper, we explore the efficacy of various modalities of feedback (visual, tactile, visual and tactile, and none) conveying proprioceptive information, specifically the error in joint angles between a desired and actual pose of a virtual prosthetic hand. Our analysis of performance in achieving and maintaining a desired prosthetic hand pose indicates a significant effect of feedback condition, with visual and visual+tactile outperforming tactile alone and a no-feedback condition. Further, the combination of tactile and visual feedback does not seem to have significant drawbacks over visual feedback alone. For tasks that rely on proprioception in the absence of visual feedback, or when attention must be focused elsewhere, we see a performance benefit to the inclusion of tactile cueing, with no lags in reaction times or requirements for increased effort measured by muscle activation. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Legal mandates to reduce resident work hours have prompted changes in the structure of surgical training programs. Such changes have included modification of on-call schedules and the adoption of "night float" resident coverage. Little is known about the effects of these changes on surgical resident education and perceptions of quality of patient care. STUDY DESIGN: The surgical housestaff and faculty at a single institution completed a 21-point Likert survey. Subjects were asked to compare parameters of resident education, patient care, and resident quality of life before and after institution of a strict 80-hour work week resident training schedule. The number of hours worked per week before and after these changes were reported. American Board of Surgery In-Training Examination (ABSITE) scores were compared for the 2 years before and after implementation of this schedule. Total number of surgical cases performed by graduating chief residents were recorded and compared for the 3 years before and after the schedule changes. RESULTS: Resident work hours reduced significantly after schedule changes were implemented. A majority of surgical residents reported an improvement in quality of life, but residents and faculty perceived changes to have a negative impact on continuity of patient care. Mean ABSITE composite percentile scores significantly improved after the reduction of working hours. ABSITE scores for junior residents improved significantly; no significant differences were noted in scores for senior residents. CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in resident work hours has salutary effects on perception of quality of life and basic education for surgical residents. These benefits may come at the expense of patient care, particularly continuity of care. This study did not directly assess patient outcomes but the perceptions of caregivers suggest that patient care may be compromised. Further research is needed to assess the longterm effects of changes on both residents and patients. © 2002 by the American College of Surgeons.},

A total of 1067 errors were identified by observational HRA: 331 consequential and 736 without consequence (ie, total error rate of 18 [SD ± 10]) per procedure. The study documented a wide variation in the number of errors between the 60 trainee surgeons. The important underlying factors for the trainee errors were (1) omission of important steps, (2) execution of steps in the wrong sequence, and (3) use of excessive force. These 3 errors accounted for 92% of consequential errors. Conclusions. This study has shown that trainees vary considerably in their propensity to commit errors. This variability indicates that the surgical training in component skills for laparoscopic surgery should be flexible and individualized. Three mechanisms account for the majority of errors and indicate that skills training in surgery has to be structured, menu driven, and tailored to individual needs. © 2005 Mosby, Inc.

   abstract = {Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) is gaining widespread adoption in many surgical specialties, despite the lack of a standardized training curriculum. Current training approaches rely heavily on virtual reality simulators, in particular for basic psychomotor and visuomotor skill development. It is not clear, however, whether training in virtual reality is equivalent to inanimate model training. In this manuscript, we seek to compare virtual reality training to inanimate model training, with regard to skill learning and skill transfer. Using a custom-developed needle-driving training task with inanimate and virtual analogs, we investigated the extent to which N=18 participants improved their skill on a given platform post-training, and transferred that skill to the opposite platform. Results indicate that the two approaches are not equivalent, with more salient skill transfer after inanimate training than virtual training. These findings support the claim that training with real physical models is the gold standard, and suggest more inanimate model training be incorporated into training curricula for early psychomotor skill development.},

   abstract = {When people judge the weight of two objects of equal mass but different size, they perceive the smaller one as being heavier. Up to date, there is no consensus about the mechanisms which give rise to this size-weight illusion. We recently suggested a model that describes heaviness perception as a weighted average of two sensory heaviness estimates with correlated noise: one estimate derived from mass, the other one derived from density. The density estimate is first derived from mass and size, but at the final perceptual level, perceived heaviness is biased by an object's density, not by its size. Here, we tested the models' prediction that weight discrimination of equal-size objects is better in lifting conditions which are prone to the size-weight illusion as compared to conditions lacking (the essentially uninformative) size information. This is predicted because in these objects density covaries with mass, and according to the model density serves as an additional sensory cue. Participants performed a two-interval forced-choice weight discrimination task. We manipulated the quality of either haptic (Experiment 1) or visual (Experiment 2) size information and measured just-noticeable differences (JNDs). Both for the haptic and the visual illusion, JNDs were lower in lifting conditions in which size information was available. Thus, when heaviness perception can be influenced by an object's density, it is more reliable. This discrimination benefit under conditions that provide the additional information that objects are of equal size is further support for the role of density and the integration of sensory estimates in the sizeweight illusion.},

   abstract = {Multi-sensory haptic systems have the potential to transfer a wide variety of information to a human user by delivering multiple types of haptic cues simultaneously. However, these systems may cause undesirable perceptual interference, which has already been observed in wearable systems that simultaneously convey skin stretch and squeeze cues. To investigate this observed perceptual interference, we conducted a psychophysical evaluation of the just-noticeable difference (JND) in skin stretch and squeeze cue magnitudes independently as well as in the presence of an interfering cue. A haptic testbed delivered each cue to a user's proximal forearm. First, the JNDs of the two haptic cues were each measured alone. Then, the cues were delivered simultaneously and the JND values for stretch with squeeze interference and squeeze with stretch interference were measured. We found that the JND for the stretch cue increased with the addition of an interference squeeze cue, while the JND for the squeeze cue did not change with interference. Results suggest that there is an interference effect between multi-sensory haptic cues that, depending on cue type, can negatively impact haptic perception. Further development of multi-sensory devices that convey salient cues has the potential to mitigate this observed interference.},

   abstract = {Objective: The lack of haptic feedback (HF) in robotic surgery is one of the major concerns of novice surgeons to that field. The superior visual appearances acquired during robotic surgery may give clues that make HF less important. Methods: We surveyed 52 individuals on their perception of HF during robotic surgery. The first group of 34 surgically inexperienced people used the da Vinci robot for their first time (drylab). The second group included 8 laparoscopic surgeons with experience up to a fifth robotic operation. The third group included 10 surgical experts with substantial experience (150-650 robotic cases). Visual analog assessment was made of perception of HF, how much HF was missed, how much the absence of HF impaired the operators' level of comfort. Robotic experts were asked if complications have occurred as a result of a lack of HF. Results: Of the first group, 50% reported the perception of HF, as did 55% of the second group and 100% of the third group (difference between group 1 and group 3: p < 0.05). The first group missed HF for 6.5; the second group for 4.3, and the third group for 4 (difference between groups 1 and 3: p < 0.05). The surgical experts claimed to have missed HF for 7.2 s when they first started robotic surgery (Difference to now: p < 0.05). The lack of HF caused discomfort for the first group of 4; for the second group of 4,4, and for the third group of 2,6. One complication was reported by the robotic experts as resulting from the lack of HF. Conclusions: The data support the conclusion that even beginners quickly experience the perception of HF when performing robotic surgery. With more experience, perception of HF and the level of comfort with robotic surgery increases significantly. This perception of HF makes "real" HF less important and demonstrates that its importance is overestimated by novices in robotic surgery. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In this study we examine the effects offeree feedback on a blunt dissection task. Twenty subjects used a telerobotic system to expose an artery in a synthetic model while viewing the operative site with a video laparoscope. Subjects were drawn from a range of surgical backgrounds, from inexperienced to attending surgeons. Performance was compared between three force feedback gains: 0% (no force feedback), 37%, and 75%. The absence of force feedback increased the average force magnitude applied to the tissue by at least 50%, and increased the peak force magnitude by at least 100%. The number of errors that damage tissue increased by over a factor of 3. The rate and precision of dissection were not significantly enhanced with force feedback. These results hold across all levels of previous surgical experience. We hypothesize that force feedback is helpful in this blunt dissection task because the artery is stiffen than the sunnounding tissue. This mechanical contrast serves to constrain the subject's hand from commanding inappropriate motions that generate large forces. © 2007 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

   abstract = {Current commercially available robotic minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) platforms provide no haptic feedback of tool interactions with the surgical environment. As a consequence, novice robotic surgeons must rely exclusively on visual feedback to sense their physical interactions with the surgical environment. This technical limitation can make it challenging and time-consuming to train novice surgeons to proficiency in RMIS. Extensive prior research has demonstrated that incorporating haptic feedback is effective at improving surgical training task performance. However, few studies have investigated the utility of providing feedback of multiple modalities of haptic feedback simultaneously (multi-modality haptic feedback) in this context, and these studies have presented mixed results regarding its efficacy. Furthermore, the inability to generalize and compare these mixed results has limited our ability to understand why they can vary significantly between studies. Therefore, we have developed a generalized, modular multi-modality haptic feedback and data acquisition framework leveraging the real-Time data acquisition and streaming capabilities of the Robot Operating System (ROS). In our preliminary study using this system, participants complete a peg transfer task using a da Vinci robot while receiving haptic feedback of applied forces, contact accelerations, or both via custom wrist-worn haptic devices. Results highlight the capability of our system in running systematic comparisons between various single and dual-modality haptic feedback approaches.},

   abstract = {Despite its expected clinical benefits, current teleoperated surgical robots do not provide the surgeon with haptic feedback largely because grounded forces can destabilize the system's closed-loop controller. This paper presents an alternative approach that enables the surgeon to feel fingertip contact deformations and vibrations while guaranteeing the teleoperator's stability. We implemented our cutaneous feedback solution on an Intuitive Surgical da Vinci Standard robot by mounting a SynTouch BioTac tactile sensor to the distal end of a surgical instrument and a custom cutaneous display to the corresponding master controller. As the user probes the remote environment, the contact deformations, dc pressure, and ac pressure (vibrations) sensed by the BioTac are directly mapped to input commands for the cutaneous device's motors using a model-free algorithm based on look-up tables. The cutaneous display continually moves, tilts, and vibrates a flat plate at the operator's fingertip to optimally reproduce the tactile sensations experienced by the BioTac. We tested the proposed approach by having eighteen subjects use the augmented da Vinci robot to palpate a heart model with no haptic feedback, only deformation feedback, and deformation plus vibration feedback. Fingertip deformation feedback significantly improved palpation performance by reducing the task completion time, the pressure exerted on the heart model, and the subject's absolute error in detecting the orientation of the embedded plastic stick. Vibration feedback significantly improved palpation performance only for the seven subjects who dragged the BioTac across the model, rather than pressing straight into it.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Interest in the training and evaluation of laparoscopic skills is extending beyond the realm of the operating room to the use of laparoscopic simulators. The purpose of this study was to develop a series of structured tasks to objectively measure laparoscopic skills. This model was then used to test for the effects of level of training and practice on performance. METHODS: Forty-two subjects (6 each of surgical residents PGY1 to PGY5, 6 surgeons who practice laparoscopy and 6 who do not) were evaluated. Each subject viewed a 20-minute introductory video, then was tested performing 7 laparoscopic tasks (peg transfers, pattern cutting, clip and divide, endolooping, mesh placement and fixation, suturing with intracorporeal or extracorporeal knots). Performance was measured using a scoring system rewarding precision and speed. Each candidate repeated all 7 tasks and was rescored. Data were analyzed by linear regression to assess the relationship of performance with level of residency training for each task, and by ANOVA with repeated measures to test for effects of level of training, of repetition, and of the interaction between level of training and repetition on overall performance. Student's t test was used to evaluate differences between laparoscopic and nonlaparoscopic surgeons and between each of these groups and the PGY 5 level of surgical residents. RESULTS: Significant predictors of overall performance were (a) level of training (P = 0.002), (b) repetition (P < 0.0001), and (c) interaction between level of training and practice (P = 0.001). There was also a significant interaction between level of training and the specific task on performance scores (P = 0.006). When each task was evaluated individually for the 30 residents, 4 of the 7 tasks (tasks 1, 2, 6, 7) showed significant correlation between PGY level and score. A significant difference in performance scores between laparoscopic and nonlaparoscopic surgeons was seen for tasks 1, 2, and 6. CONCLUSIONS: A model was developed to evaluate laparoscopic skills. Construct validity was demonstrated by measuring significant improvement in performance with increasing residency training, and with practice. Further validation will require correlation of performance in the model with skill in vivo.},

Compared to currently marketed prostheses, the MPL has a greater number of sequential and simultaneous degrees of motion, as well as wrist modularity, haptic feedback, and individual digit control. The MPL was successfully fit to a 33-year-old with a trans-radial amputation (TR01) and a 30-year-old with a wrist disarticulation amputation (TR02). To preserve anatomical limb length, we adjusted the powered degrees of freedom of wrist motion between users. Motor training began with practicing sEMG and pattern recognition control within the virtual integration environment (VIE). Prosthetic training sessions then allowed participants to complete a variety of activities of daily living with the MPL. Training and Motion Control Accuracy scores quantified their ability to consistently train and execute unique muscle-to-motion contraction patterns. Each user also completed one prosthetic functional metric-the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) for TR01 and the Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JHFT) for TR02. Haptic feedback capabilities were integrated for TR01. TR01 achieved 95% accuracy at 84% of his VIE sessions. He demonstrated improved scores over a year of prosthetic training sessions, ultimately achieving simultaneous control of 13 of the 17 (76%) attempted motions. His performance on the SHAP improved from baseline to final assessment with an increase in number of tasks achieved. TR01 also used vibrotactile sensors to successfully discriminate between hard and soft objects being grasped by the MPL hand. TR02 demonstrated 95% accuracy at 79% of his VIE sessions. He demonstrated improved scores over months of prosthetic training sessions, however there was a significant drop in scores initially following a mid-study pause in testing. He ultimately achieved simultaneous control of all 13 attempted powered motions, and both attempted passive motions. He completed 5 of the 7 (71%) JHFT tasks within the testing time limit. These case studies confirm that it is possible to use non-invasive motor control to increase functional outcomes with individuals with below-elbow amputation and will help to guide future myoelectric prosthetic studies.},

To date, advances in wearable haptic devices have typically focused on the optimization of haptic cue transmission using a single modality, or have combined two types of cutaneous feedbacks, each mapped to a particular parameter of the task. Alternatively, researchers have employed arrays of haptic tactile actuators to maximize information throughput to a user. However, when large cue sets are to be transmitted, such as those required to communicate language, perceptual interference between transmitted cues can decrease the efficacy of single-sensory systems, or require large footprints to ensure salient spatiotemporal cues are rendered to the user. In this paper, we present a wearable, multi-sensory haptic feedback system, MISSIVE (Multi-sensory Interface of Stretch, Squeeze, and Integrated Vibration Elements), that conveys multi-sensory haptic cues to the user's upper arm. We present experimental results that demonstrate that rendering haptic cues with multi-sensory components - specifically, lateral skin stretch, radial squeeze, and vibrotactile stimuli - improved perceptual distinguishability in comparison to similar cues with all-vibrotactile components. These results support the incorporation of diverse stimuli, both vibrotactile and nonvibrotactile, for applications requiring large haptic cue sets.},

The da Vinci robot is currently being used in various fields such as urology, general surgery, gynecology, cardio-thoracic, pediatric and ENT surgery. It provides several advantages to conventional laparoscopy such as 3D vision, motion scaling, intuitive movements, visual immersion and tremor filtration.

   abstract = {As haptics becomes an integral component of scientific data visualization systems, there is a growing need to study "haptic glyphs" (building blocks for displaying information through the sense of touch) and quantify their information transmission capability. The present study investigated the channel capacity for transmitting information through stiffness or force magnitude. Specifically, we measured the number of stiffness or forcemagnitude levels that can be reliably identified in an absolute identification paradigm. The range of stiffness and force magnitude used in the present study, 0.2-3.0 N/mm and 0.1-5.0 N, respectively, was typical of the parameter values encountered in most virtual reality or data visualization applications. Ten individuals participated in a stiffness identification experiment, each completing 250 trials. Subsequently, four of these individuals and six additional participants completed 250 trials in a force-magnitude identification experiment. A custom-designed 3 degrees-of-freedom force-feedback device, the ministick, was used for stimulus delivery. The results showed an average information transfer of 1.46 bits for stiffness identification, or equivalently, 2.8 correctly-identifiable stiffness levels. The average information transfer for force magnitude was 1.54 bits, or equivalently, 2.9 correctly-identifiable force magnitudes. Therefore, on average, the participants could only reliably identify 2-3 stiffness levels in the range of 0.2-3.0 N/mm, and 2-3 force-magnitude levels in the range of 0.1-5.0 N. Individual performance varied from 1 to 4 correctly-identifiable stiffness levels and 2 to 4 correctly-identifiable force-magnitude levels. Our results are consistent with reported information transfers for haptic stimuli. Based on the present study, it is recommended that 2 stiffness or force-magnitude levels (i.e., high and low) be used with haptic glyphs in a data visualization system, with an additional third level (medium) for more experienced users. © 2008 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Rendering forces to the user is one of the main goals of haptic technology. While most force-feedback interfaces are robotic manipulators, attached to a fixed frame and designed to exert forces on the users while being moved, more recent haptic research introduced two novel important ideas. On one side, cutaneous stimulation aims at rendering haptic stimuli at the level of the skin, with a distributed, rather than, concentrated approach. On the other side, wearable haptics focuses on highly portable and mobile devices, which can be carried and worn by the user as the haptic equivalent of an mp3 player. This paper presents a light and simple wearable device (CUFF) for the distributed mechano-tactile stimulation of the user's arm skin with pressure and stretch cues, related to normal and tangential forces, respectively. The working principle and the mechanical and control implementation of the CUFF device are presented. Then, after a basic functional validation, a first application of the device is shown, where it is used to render the grasping force of a robotic hand (the Pisa/IIT SoftHand). Preliminary results show that the device is capable to deliver in a reliable manner grasping force information, thus eliciting a good softness discrimination in users and enhancing the overall grasping experience.},

   abstract = {Work by our group and others employed the within-participants variability in peak grip aperture as a ‘just-noticeable-difference’ (JND) in grasping. Notably, our group reported that grasping responses with decoupled spatial relations between stimulus and response (i.e., pantomime-grasping) produced JNDs that increased linearly with increasing target object size (i.e., adherence to Weber's law) and interpreted that result as law-based evidence of aperture shaping via relative visual information. In contrast, Utz et al. (2015) reported that pantomime-grasping elicits an inverse JND/object size relationship and proposed that JNDs in grasping do not reflect the sensory properties of a target object but rather reflect range effects in the biomechanical limits of aperture opening (i.e., the biomechanical hypothesis). Thus, the biomechanical hypothesis asserts that small objects have a larger range of possible aperture values than larger objects due to reduced biomechanical freedom associated with the hand's effective range of motion. To test the biomechanical hypothesis we measured participants’ maximal thumb and forefinger separation and custom-built target objects with widths that matched decile increments (i.e., 10 through 80%) of each participant's effective range of motion. Results showed that JNDs increased linearly with increasing target object size – a result incompatible with the biomechanical hypothesis. Instead, the JND/object size relationship observed here supports convergent evidence that pantomime-grasping is a perception-based task mediated via relative visual information.},

Here, we contrasted pantomime-grasps performed with (H+) and without (H−) haptic feedback (i.e., thumb and forefinger position information derived from the grasping hand touching the object) with a condition providing visual KR (VKR) related to absolute target object size. Just-noticeable-difference (JND) scores were computed to determine whether responses adhered to–or violated–Weber's law. JNDs for H+ trials violated the law, whereas H− and VKR trials adhered to the law. Accordingly, results demonstrate that haptic feedback–and not KR–supports an absolute tactile-haptic calibration.},

   abstract = {We investigated the issue of whether or not the CNS makes use of an internal model of the motor apparatus in planning and controlling arm movements. In particular, we tested the ability of subjects to predict different hand-held loads by examining grip force adjustments used to stabilize the load in the hand during arm movements. Subjects grasped a manipulandum using a precision grip with the tips of the thumb and index finger on either side. The grip force (normal to the contact surfaces) and the load force (tangential to the surfaces) were measured, along with the trajectory of the hand. The manipulandum was attached to two servo-controlled linear motors used to create inertial and viscous loads as well as a composite load, including inertial, viscous, and elastic components. The form of the hand trajectory was independent of load for some subjects but varied systematically across load conditions in others. Nevertheless, under all load conditions and in all subjects, grip force was modulated in parallel with, and thus anticipated, fluctuations in load force despite the marked variation in the form of the load function. This indicates that the CNS is able to predict the load force and the kinematics of hand movement on which the load depends. We suggest this prediction is based on an internal model of the motor apparatus and external load and is used to determine the grip forces required to stabilize the load.},

   abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effects of adding vibrotactile feedback to myoelectric prosthesis users on the performance time and visual attention in a dual-task paradigm. Design: A repeated-measures design with a counterbalanced order of two conditions. Setting: Laboratory setting. Subjects: Transradial amputees using a myoelectric prosthesis with normal or corrected eyesight (N = 12, median age = 65 ± 13 years). Exclusion criteria were orthopedic or neurologic problems. Interventions: Subjects performed grasping tasks with their prosthesis, while controlling a virtual car on a road with their intact hand. The dual task was performed twice: with and without vibrotactile feedback. Main measures: Performance time of each of the grasping tasks and gaze behavior, measured by the number of times the subjects shifted their gaze toward their hand, the relative time they applied their attention to the screen, and percentage of error in the secondary task. Results: The mean performance time was significantly shorter (P = 0.024) when using vibrotactile feedback (93.2 ± 9.6 seconds) compared with the performance time measured when vibrotactile feedback was not available (107.8 ± 20.3 seconds). No significant differences were found between the two conditions in the number of times the gaze shifted from the screen to the hand, in the time the subjects applied their attention to the screen, and in the time the virtual car was off-road, as a percentage of the total game time (51.4 ± 15.7 and 50.2 ± 19.5, respectively). Conclusion: Adding vibrotactile feedback improved performance time during grasping in a dual-task paradigm. Prosthesis users may use vibrotactile feedback to perform better during daily tasks, when multiple cognitive demands are present.},

   abstract = {Optimising haptic sensitivity in visual-haptic interfaces can have important benefits, particularly in situations where visual information is relatively unreliable (for example in surgical devices, where there is often a lack of normal visual depth cues). Many haptic devices alter the normal relationship between object size and hand opening, and so might be expected to alter haptic sensitivity. To determine how to optimise haptic sensitivity in such situations, we measured haptic size sensitivity as a function of object size (i) during normal grasping, and (ii) using pliers-like tools that changed the gain between hand opening and object size. Haptic stimuli were created using force-feedback robots, and we measured discrimination thresholds using a two-interval forced-choice task. We first showed that when participants directly grasped objects with their hands haptic size sensitivity did not follow Weber’s law, but instead varied non-monotonically with object size/hand opening; thresholds were lowest for object sizes around 45 mm and increased non-linearly for larger and smaller objects. Second, when using the pliers, sensitivity in units of hand opening was unchanged from normal grasping. Thus, thresholds in units of object size were simply the product of the non-monotonic haptic size sensitivity function, above, and the tool gain. Taken together, these results show that there is a unique tool gain that maximises haptic sensitivity to each object size. Our results show how the ‘tool gain’ of haptic devices should be altered to optimise sensitivity to the range of object sizes in a particular scene.},

This study evaluates 10 forms of tactile feedback for guidance of wrist rotation to understand the traits that influence the effectiveness of such systems. We present five wearable actuators capable of tapping, dragging across, squeezing, twisting, or vibrating against the user's wrist; each actuator can be controlled via steady or pulsing drive algorithms. Ten subjects used each form of feedback to perform three unsighted movement tasks: directional response, position targeting, and trajectory following. The results show that directional responses are fastest when direction is conveyed through the location of the tactile stimulus or steady lateral skin stretch. Feedback that clearly conveys movement direction enables subjects to reach target positions most quickly, though tactile magnitude cues (steady intensity and especially pulsing frequency) can also be used when direction is difficult to discern. Subjects closely tracked arbitrary trajectories only when both movement direction and cue magnitude were subjectively rated as very easy to discern. The best overall performance was achieved by the actuator that repeatedly taps on the subject's wrist on the side toward which they should turn. © 2008-2011 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Visually guided grasping movements directed to real, 3D objects are characterized by a distinguishable trajectory pattern that evades the influence of Weber’s law, a basic principle of perception. Conversely, grasping trajectories directed to 2D line drawings of objects adhere to Weber’s law. It can be argued, therefore, that during 2D grasping, the visuomotor system fails at operating in analytic mode and is intruded by irrelevant perceptual information. Here, we explored the visual and tactile cues that enable such analytic processing during grasping. In Experiment 1, we compared grasping directed to 3D objects with grasping directed to 2D object photos. Grasping directed to photos adhered to Weber’s law, suggesting that richness in visual detail does not contribute to analytic processing. In Experiment 2, we tested whether the visual presentation of 3D objects could support analytic processing even when only partial object-specific tactile information is provided. Surprisingly, grasping could be performed in an analytic fashion, violating Weber’s law. In Experiment 3, participants were denied of any haptic feedback at the end of the movement and grasping trajectories again showed adherence to Weber’s law. Taken together, the findings suggest that the presentation of real objects combined with indirect haptic information at the end of the movement is sufficient to allow analytic processing during grasp.},

   abstract = {During robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, surgeons perform challenging dexterous tasks, including the manipulation of soft tissue and suture tying. In the absence of environment force sensing of tool-tissue interaction forces to provide force feedback, surgeons must rely on visual feedback to modulate the grip force they apply on the environment. Clinical systems, like the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.), use physical springs to provide closing resistance on the gripper degree-of-freedom (DOF) of the master manipulator. This feedback provides increasing force resistance as the gripper is closed. To determine the effect of master manipulator gripper stiffness on performance in a teleoperated manipulation task, we designed a new and open source gripper, the OmniGrip. The OmniGrip attaches to a SensAble Phantom Omni (now available as Geomagic Touch), replacing the stylus end effector, and providing the ability for user programmable force characteristics. We conducted a study in which participants used an OmniGrip to teleoperate a Raven II surgical robotic system in a pick-and-place task. Increasing the stiffness of the OmniGrip resulted in reduced interaction forces at the slave-side environment. Additionally, these interaction forces were significantly lower when the OmniGrip as compared to when using the Phantom Omni stylus.},

   abstract = {In virtual reality (VR), spatial awareness is a dominant research topic. It plays an essential role in the assessment of human operators' behavior within virtual environments (VE), notably for the evaluation of the feasibility of manual maintenance tasks in cluttered industrial settings. In such contexts, it is decisive to evaluate the spatial and temporal correspondence between the operator's movement kinematics and that of his/her virtual avatar in the virtual environment. Often, in a cluttered VE, direct kinesthetic (force) feedback is limited or absent. We tested whether vibrotactile (cutaneous) feedback would increase visuo-proprioceptive consistency, spatial awareness, and thus the validity of VR studies, by augmenting the perception of the operator's contact(s) with virtual objects. We present preliminary experimental results, obtained using a head-mounted display (HMD) during a goal-directed task in a cluttered VE. Data suggest that spatialized vibrotactile feedback contributes to visuo-proprioceptive consistency.},

   abstract = {Virtual-reality and telerobotic devices simulate local motor control of virtual objects within computerized environments. Here, we explored grasping kinematics within a virtual environment and tested whether, as in normal 3D grasping, trajectories in the virtual environment are performed analytically, violating Weber’s law with respect to object’s size. Participants were asked to grasp a series of 2D objects using a haptic system, which projected their movements to a virtual space presented on a computer screen. The apparatus also provided object-specific haptic information upon “touching” the edges of the virtual targets. The results showed that grasping movements performed within the virtual environment did not produce the typical analytical trajectory pattern obtained during 3D grasping. Unlike as in 3D grasping, grasping trajectories in the virtual environment adhered to Weber’s law, which indicates relative resolution in size processing. In addition, the trajectory patterns differed from typical trajectories obtained during 3D grasping, with longer times to complete the movement, and with maximum grip apertures appearing relatively early in the movement. The results suggest that grasping movements within a virtual environment could differ from those performed in real space, and are subjected to irrelevant effects of perceptual information. Such atypical pattern of visuomotor control may be mediated by the lack of complete transparency between the interface and the virtual environment in terms of the provided visual and haptic feedback. Possible implications of the findings to movement control within robotic and virtual environments are further discussed.},

Single modality haptic feedback systems have been designed and tested in an attempt to diminish grasping forces, but the results still fall short of natural performance. A multi-modal pneumatic feedback system was designed to allow for tactile, kinesthetic, and vibrotactile feedback, with the aims of more closely imitating natural touch and further improving the effectiveness of HFS in robotic surgical applications and tasks such as tissue grasping and manipulation. Testing of the multi-modal system yielded very promising results with an average force reduction of nearly 50% between the no feedback and hybrid (tactile and kinesthetic) trials (p < 1.0E-16). The multi-modal system demonstrated an increased reduction over single modality feedback solutions and indicated that the system can help users achieve average grip forces closer to those normally possible with the human hand.},

   abstract = {IMPORTANCE Robotic-assisted cholecystectomy is rapidly being adopted into practice, partly based on the belief that it offers specific technical and safety advantages over traditional laparoscopic surgery. Whether robotic-assisted cholecystectomy is safer than laparoscopic cholecystectomy remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To determine the uptake of robotic-assisted cholecystectomy and to analyze its comparative safety vs laparoscopic cholecystectomy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective cohort study used Medicare administrative claims data for nonfederal acute care hospitals from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2019. Participants included 1 026 088 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries 66 to 99 years of age who underwent cholecystectomy with continuous Medicare coverage for 3 months before and 12 months after surgery. Data were analyzed August 17, 2022, to June 1, 2023. EXPOSURE Surgical technique used to perform cholecystectomy: robotic-assisted vs laparoscopic approaches. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was rate of bile duct injury requiring definitive surgical reconstruction within 1 year after cholecystectomy. Secondary outcomes were composite outcome of bile duct injury requiring less-invasive postoperative surgical or endoscopic biliary interventions, and overall incidence of 30-day complications. Multivariable logistic analysis was performed adjusting for patient factors and clustered within hospital referral regions. An instrumental variable analysis was performed, leveraging regional variation in the adoption of robotic-assisted cholecystectomy within hospital referral regions over time, to account for potential confounding from unmeasured differences between treatment groups. RESULTS A total of 1 026 088 patients (mean [SD] age, 72 [12.0] years; 53.3% women) were included in the study. The use of robotic-assisted cholecystectomy increased 37-fold from 211 of 147 341 patients (0.1%) in 2010 to 6507 of 125 211 patients (5.2%) in 2019. Compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy, robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was associated with a higher rate of bile duct injury necessitating a definitive operative repair within 1 year (0.7% vs 0.2%; relative risk [RR], 3.16 [95% CI, 2.57-3.75]). Robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was also associated with a higher rate of postoperative biliary interventions, such as endoscopic stenting (7.4% vs 6.0%; RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.16-1.33]). There was no significant difference in overall 30-day complication rates between the 2 procedures. The instrumental variable analysis, which was designed to account for potential unmeasured differences in treatment groups, also showed that robotic-assisted cholecystectomy was associated with a higher rate of bile duct injury (0.4% vs 0.2%; RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 1.14-2.63]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This cohort study’s finding of significantly higher rates of bile duct injury with robotic-assisted cholecystectomy compared with laparoscopic cholecystectomy suggests that the utility of robotic-assisted cholecystectomy should be reconsidered, given the existence of an already minimally invasive, predictably safe laparoscopic approach.},

However, existing methods can be time consuming, labor intensive, and subject to bias. Machine learning (ML) has the potential to provide rapid, automated, and reproducible feedback without the need for expert reviewers. We aimed to systematically review the literature and determine the ML techniques used for technical surgical skill assessment and identify challenges and barriers in the field. A systematic literature search, in accordance with the PRISMA statement, was performed to identify studies detailing the use of ML for technical skill assessment in surgery. Of the 1896 studies that were retrieved, 66 studies were included. The most common ML methods used were Hidden Markov Models (HMM, 14/66), Support Vector Machines (SVM, 17/66), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN, 17/66). 40/66 studies used kinematic data, 19/66 used video or image data, and 7/66 used both. Studies assessed the performance of benchtop tasks (48/66), simulator tasks (10/66), and real-life surgery (8/66). Accuracy rates of over 80% were achieved, although tasks and participants varied between studies. Barriers to progress in the field included a focus on basic tasks, lack of standardization between studies, and lack of datasets. ML has the potential to produce accurate and objective surgical skill assessment through the use of methods including HMM, SVM, and ANN. Future ML-based assessment tools should move beyond the assessment of basic tasks and towards real-life surgery and provide interpretable feedback with clinical value for the surgeon.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the transferability of expertise in conventional laparoscopy and open surgery to robotic-assisted surgery using the da Vinci Skills Simulator (dVSS). Secondary aims included evaluating the influence of individual participants’ characteristics. Methods: Participants performed four tasks on the dVSS: Peg Board 1 (PB), Pick and Place (PP), Thread the Rings (TR), and Suture Sponge 1 (SS). Participants were classified into three groups (Novice, Intermediate, Experts) according to experience in laparoscopic and open surgery. All tasks were performed twice except for SS. Performance was assessed using the built-in scoring system. Results: 37 medical students and 25 surgeons participated. Experts did not perform significantly better than less experienced participants on the dVSS. Specifically, with regard to laparoscopic experience, total simulator scores were: Novices 68.2 ± 28.8; Intermediates 65.1 ± 31.2; Experts 65.1 ± 30.0; p = 0.611. Regarding open surgical experience, scores were: Novices 68.6 ± 28.7; Intermediates 68.2 ± 30.8; Experts 63.2 ± 30.3; p = 0.305. Although there were some significant differences among groups for single parameters in specific tasks, there was no constant superiority of one group. Laparoscopic and open surgical Novices improved significantly in overall score and time for all three tasks (p OpenSPiltSPi 0.05). Laparoscopic intermediates improved only in PP time (4.64 ± 3.42; p = 0.006), open Intermediates in PB score (11.98 ± 13.01; p = 0.025), and open Experts in PP score (6.69 ± 11.48; p = 0.048). Laparoscopic experts showed no improvement. Participants with gaming experience had better overall scores than non-gamers when comparing all second attempts (Gamer 83.62 ± 7.57; Non-Gamer 76.31 ± 12.78; p = 0.008) as well as first and second attempts together (Gamer 72.08 ± 8.86; Non-Gamer 65.45 ± 11.68; p = 0.039). Musical and sports experience showed no correlation with robotic performance. Conclusions: Robotic-assisted surgery requires skills distinct from conventional laparoscopy or open surgery. Basic robotic skills training prior to patient contact should be required.},

   abstract = {Background: The technical skill of surgical trainees is not well assessed. This study aimed (1) to compare the reliability of three scoring systems, (2) to compare live and bench formats and (3) to assess construct validity of a test of operative skill. Methods: Parallel examinations of operative skill, one using live animals and one using simulations, were developed. Performance was graded using operation-specific checklists, detailed global rating forms and pass/fail judgements. Twenty surgical residents each took both formats. Results: Disattenuated correlations between live and bench scores were high (0.69-0.72). Mean inter-rater reliability across stations ranged from 0.64 to 0.72. Internal consistency was moderate to high (α: 0.61-0.74) for the live format using the checklist and for live and bench formats using global ratings. Global ratings discriminated between resident levels for both formats (bench: F(2,17) = 4.45, P < 0.05; live: F(2,17) = 3.55, P < 0.05), checklists did not. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill can reliably and validly assess surgical skills. Global ratings are a better method of assessment than task-specific checklists. Bench model simulation gives equivalent results to use of live animals for this test format.},

Therefore, robotic surgery has made many steps forward gaining more diffusion in the field of general surgery and this trend was associated with a decrease in laparoscopic surgery. Although the safety and effectiveness of robotic surgical systems in most procedures has been confirmed, some difficult procedures have not been widely performed but rather limited to a few highly specialized centers. This study describes the worldwide diffusion of robotic surgery in their respective fields in terms of hepatectomy, gastrectomy, esophagectomy, colectomy and pancreatectomy, respectively. The worldwide diffusion of robotic surgery is uneven, which may be related to the local economic strength, government health care policies, and surgeons' preference for minimally invasive surgery of various countries and regions. In the future, with the gradual decrease of cost of robotic surgical systems, and the standardization of surgical procedures, as well as the coverage of medical insurance, we believe that robotic surgery will become the gold standard procedure in general surgery.},

   abstract = {During traditional surgery, the surgeons’ hands are in direct contact with organs, and surgeons rely on the sense of touch to perform surgery. In teleoperated robotic systems, all physical connections between the surgeon and both the robot and patient, are absent. The surgeon must estimate the force exerted on organs, based only on visual deformation of tissues he is pulling, pushing, gripping, or suturing. It is hard to imagine how to operate with no haptic sensations, and it is surprising that commercially available robots didn’t include until now any Haptic Feedback, despite reports about tissue injury, and inability to perform complex manipulation. The sense of touch must be created by stimuli sensed by the surgeon. Haptic sensors are required to collect and send haptic information, and display them on the operator’s side, creating telepresence, known as transparency. Multiple ways have been developed to improve transparency through force feedback and tactile feedback. However, this interferes with the stability of the closed-loop controlling interactions between master, robot and remote environment. Cutaneous feedback is more stable and less transparent; force feedback is more transparent and less stable. Thus, multimodal platforms of haptic feedback would try to find the best trade-off between both modalities.},

All parameters from the scale allow discriminating between different levels of experience, with exception of the depth perception item. We conclude that the scale GEARS was able to differentiate between individuals with different levels of experience in robotic surgery and, therefore, is a validated and useful tool to evaluate surgeons in training.},

   abstract = {Background: The use of simulation for laparoscopic training has led to the development of objective tools for skills assessment. Motion analysis represents one area of focus. This study was designed to assess the evidence for the use of motion analysis as a valid tool for laparoscopic skills assessment. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE and PubMed were searched using the following domains: (1) motion analysis, (2) validation and (3) laparoscopy. Studies investigating motion analysis as a tool for assessment of laparoscopic skill in general surgery were included. Common endpoints in motion analysis metrics were compared between studies according to a modified form of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence and recommendation. Results: Thirteen studies were included from 2,039 initial papers. Twelve (92.3 %) reported the construct validity of motion analysis across a range of laparoscopic tasks. Of these 12, 5 (41.7 %) evaluated the ProMIS Augmented Reality Simulator, 3 (25 %) the Imperial College Surgical Assessment Device (ICSAD), 2 (16.7 %) the Hiroshima University Endoscopic Surgical Assessment Device (HUESAD), 1 (8.33 %) the Advanced Dundee Endoscopic Psychomotor Tester (ADEPT) and 1 (8.33 %) the Robotic and Video Motion Analysis Software (ROVIMAS). Face validity was reported by 1 (7.7 %) study each for ADEPT and ICSAD. Concurrent validity was reported by 1 (7.7 %) study each for ADEPT, ICSAD and ProMIS. There was no evidence for predictive validity. Conclusions: Evidence exists to validate motion analysis for use in laparoscopic skills assessment. Valid parameters are time taken, path length and number of hand movements. Future work should concentrate on the conversion of motion data into competency-based scores for trainee feedback. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {Purpose:Robotic surgeries, especially in urology, have grown exponentially during the last decade. Various skills assessment tools have been developed. We reviewed the current status, the current challenges and the future needs of robotic evaluations with a focus on urological applications.Materials and Methods:According to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) criteria 2 paired investigators screened the PubMed®, Scopus® and Web of Science® databases for all full text, English language articles published between 2006 and 2018 using the query (evaluation OR assessment) AND (robot-assisted surgery OR robotic surgery) AND (surgical performance OR surgical skill) AND training. The research design, validity and reliability of each study were ascertained and analyzed.Results:A total of 259 studies were identified, of which 109 were included in the final analysis. We grouped the studies into 2 categories, including manual and automated assessments. Manual evaluation included global skill, procedure specific and error based assessments. For automated assessment we summarized evaluations derived from robotic instrument kinematic tracking data, systems events and surgical video data, and we explored those associations with various domains by manual evaluation. We further reviewed the current progress in automated surgical segmentation and skill evaluation with machine learning and deep learning. Concerns remain regarding efficient and effective surgeon training and credentialing.Conclusions:No universally accepted robotic skills assessment currently exists. The purpose of assessment (training or credentialing) may dictate whether manual or automated surgeon assessment is more suitable. Moving forward, assessment tools must be objective and efficient to facilitate the training and credentialing of competent surgeons.},

   abstract = {Force is crucial for learning psychomotor skills in laparoscopic tissue manipulation. Fundamental laparoscopic surgery (FLS), on the other hand, only measures time and position accuracy. FLS is a commonly used training program for basic laparoscopic training through part tasks. The FLS is employed in most of the laparoscopic training systems, including box trainers and virtual reality (VR) simulators. However, many laparoscopic VR simulators lack force feedback and measure tissue damage solely through visual feedback based on virtual collisions. Few VR simulators that provide force feedback have subjective force metrics. To provide an objective force assessment for haptic skills training in the VR simulators, we extend the FLS part tasks to haptic-based FLS (HFLS), focusing on controlled force exertion. We interface the simulated HFLS part tasks with a customized bi-manual haptic simulator that offers five degrees of freedom (DOF) for force feedback. The proposed tasks are evaluated through face and content validity among laparoscopic surgeons of varying experience levels. The results show that trainees perform better in HFLS tasks. The average Likert score observed for face and content validity is greater than 4.6 ± 0.3 and 4 ± 0.5 for all the part tasks, which indicates the acceptance of the simulator among subjects for its appearance and functionality. Face and content validations show the need to improve haptic realism, which is also observed in existing simulators. To enhance the accuracy of force rendering, we incorporated a laparoscopic tool force model into the simulation. We study the effectiveness of the model through a psychophysical study that measures just noticeable difference (JND) for the laparoscopic gripping task. The study reveals an insignificant decrease in gripping-force JND. A simple linear model could be sufficient for gripper force feedback, and a non-linear LapTool force model does not affect the force perception for the force range of 0.5–2.5 N. Further study is required to understand the usability of the force model in laparoscopic training at a higher force range. Additionally, the construct validity of HFLS will confirm the applicability of the developed simulator to train surgeons with different levels of experience.},

   abstract = {Background: Validated training exercises are essential tools for surgeons as they develop technical skills to use robot-assisted minimally invasive surgical systems. The purpose of this study was to show face, content, and construct validity of four, inanimate training exercises using the da Vinci®Si surgical system configured with Single-Site™ instrumentation. Methods: New (N = 21) and experienced (N = 6) surgeons participated in the study. New surgeons (11 Gynecology [GYN] and 10 General Surgery [GEN]) had not completed any da Vinci Single-Site cases but may have completed multiport cases using the da Vinci system. They participated in this study prior to attending a certification course focused on da Vinci Single-Site instrumentation. Experienced surgeons (5 GYN and 1 GEN) had completed at least 25 da Vinci Single-Site cases. The surgeons completed four inanimate training exercises and then rated them with a questionnaire. Raw metrics and overall normalized scores were computed using both video recordings and kinematic data collected from the surgical system. Results: The experienced surgeons significantly outperformed new surgeons for many raw metrics and the overall normalized scores derived from video review (p < 0.05). Only one exercise did not achieve a significant difference between new and experienced surgeons (p = 0.08) when calculating an overall normalized score using both video and advanced metrics derived from kinematic data. Both new and experienced surgeons rated the training exercises as appearing, to train and measure technical skills used during da Vinci Single-Site surgery and actually testing the technical skills used during da Vinci Single-Site surgery. Conclusions: In summary, the four training exercises showed face, content, and construct validity. Improved overall scores could be developed using additional metrics not included in this study. The results suggest that the training exercises could be used in an overall training curriculum aimed at developing proficiency in technical skills for surgeons new to da Vinci Single-Site instrumentation.},

   abstract = {Background: Current evaluation methods for robotic-assisted surgery (ARCS or GEARS) are limited to 5-point Likert scales which are inherently time-consuming and require a degree of subjective scoring. In this study, we demonstrate a method to break down complex robotic surgical procedures using a combination of an objective cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis and kinematics data obtained from the da Vinci® Surgical System to evaluate the performance of novice robotic surgeons. Methods: Two HPB fellows performed 40 robotic-assisted hepaticojejunostomy reconstructions to model a portion of a Whipple procedure. Kinematics data from the da Vinci® system was recorded using the dV Logger® while CUSUM analyses were performed for each procedural step. Each kinematic variable was modeled using machine learning to reflect the fellows’ learning curves for each task. Statistically significant kinematics variables were then combined into a single formula to create the operative robotic index (ORI). Results: The inflection points of our overall CUSUM analysis showed improvement in technical performance beginning at trial 16. The derived ORI model showed a strong fit to our observed kinematics data (R2 = 0.796) with an ability to distinguish between novice and intermediate robotic performance with 89.3% overall accuracy. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach to objectively break down novice performance on the da Vinci® Surgical System. We identified kinematics variables associated with improved overall technical performance to create an objective ORI. This approach to robotic operative evaluation demonstrates a valuable method to break down complex surgical procedures in an objective, stepwise fashion. Continued research into objective methods of evaluation for robotic surgery will be invaluable for future training and clinical implementation of the robotic platform.},

   abstract = {Background: As more surgeons choose to complete procedures robotically, validated training tools are needed so that they can acquire and maintain the technical skills required to proficiently use robotic systems. The purpose of this study was to show construct validity of nine new inanimate training exercises for robot-assisted surgery. The inanimate training exercises were designed to span several core technical skills required to use a robotic system. Methods: New (n = 30) and experienced (n = 11) robotic surgeons participated in the study. New robotic surgeons had not yet completed their first robotic surgery case and participated in this study before attending their robotic certification course. Experienced robotic surgeons had completed more than 200 robotic surgery cases. The raw scores from the exercises were reported so that other research groups could easily define custom proficiency levels. Example normalized scores that could be used in proficiency-based curricula were computed. These normalized scores balanced efficiency (completion time) and accuracy (exercise-specific errors) to measure performance. Finally, the setup was standardized using a custom docking model, which enabled consistent and repeatable completion of the inanimate exercises across surgeons. Results: For all nine exercises, experienced robotic surgeons completed the exercises significantly faster than new robotic surgeons (p < 0.01). Similarly, experienced robotic surgeons achieved higher normalized scores than new robotic surgeons for all nine exercises (p < 0.01). Finally, consistent robot setup was achieved using the custom docking model based on an analysis of the robot kinematic data. Conclusions: In summary, all nine inanimate exercises showed construct validity. The results suggest that the inanimate exercises along with the custom docking model can be used as part of proficiency-based curricula to improve robotic surgeon training. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.},

   abstract = {Background: Recent studies have correlated surgical skill measured by video-based assessment with improved clinical outcomes. Certain automated measures of operative performance in robotic surgery can be gathered beyond video review called objective performance indicators (OPIs). We explore the relationship between OPIs, surgeon experience, and postoperative recovery, hypothesizing that more efficient dissection will be associated with experience. Methods: Fifty-six robotic cholecystectomies between February 2022 and March 2023 were recorded at a large tertiary referral center. Surgeon experience and clinical outcomes data from the EMR were obtained for all 56 cases with 10 completing the QOL survey. Two steps of robotic cholecystectomies were reviewed: dissection of Calot's triangle (DCT) and dissection of the gallbladder from the liver (DGL). Postoperative recovery was measured using the SF-36 well-being survey. Univariate analysis was conducted using Pearson’s coefficient. Results: Increased operative experience was associated with more efficient camera and instrument movements. DCT had 7 and DGL had 31 of 41 OPIs that correlated with experience. With respect to DGL, more experienced surgeons had reduced step duration and instrument path length and increased camera and instrument speeds. Conclusions: Several OPIs correlate with surgical experience and may form the basis of more instructive feedback for trainees and less experienced surgeons in improving intraoperative technique.},

   abstract = {Background: Surgical training requires clinical knowledge and technical skills to operate safely and optimize clinical outcomes. Technical skills are hard to measure. The Intuitive Data Recorder (IDR), (Sunnyvale, CA) allows for the measurement of technical skills using objective performance indicators (OPIs) from kinematic event data. Our goal was to determine whether OPIs improve with surgeon experience and whether they are correlated with clinical outcomes for robotic inguinal hernia repair (RIHR). Methods: The IDR was used to record RIHRs from six surgeons. Data were obtained from 98 inguinal hernia repairs from February 2022 to February 2023. Patients were called on postoperative days 5–10 and asked to take the Carolina Comfort Scale (CCS) survey to evaluate acute clinical outcomes. A Pearson test was run to determine correlations between OPIs from the IDR with a surgeon’s yearly RIHR experience and with CCS scores. Linear regression was then run for correlated OPIs. Results: Multiple OPIs were correlated with surgeon experience. Specifically, for the task of peritoneal flap exploration, we found that 23 OPIs were significantly correlated with surgeons’ 1-year RIHR case number. Total angular motion distance of the left arm instrument had a correlation of − 0.238 (95% CI − 0.417, − 0.042) for RIHR yearly case number. Total angular motion distance of right arm instrument was also negatively correlated with RIHR in 1 year with a correlation of − 0.242 (95% CI − 0.420, − 0.046). For clinical outcomes, wrist articulation of the surgeon’s console positively correlated with acute sensation scores from the CCS with a correlation of 0.453 (95% CI 0.013, 0.746). Conclusions: This study defines multiple OPIs that correlate with surgeon experience and with outcomes. Using this knowledge, surgical simulation platforms can be designed to teach patterns to surgical trainees that are associated with increased surgical experience and with improved postoperative outcomes.

   abstract = {The objective of this study is to determine the ability of the GEARS scale (Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills) to differentiate individuals with different levels of experience in robotic surgery, as a fundamental validation. This is a cross-sectional study that included three groups of individuals with different levels of experience in robotic surgery (expert, intermediate, novice) their performance were assessed by GEARS applied by two reviewers. The difference between groups was determined by Mann–Whitney test and the consistency between the reviewers was studied by Kendall W coefficient. The agreement between the reviewers of the scale GEARS was 0.96. The score was 29.8 ± 0.4 to experts, 24 ± 2.8 to intermediates and 16 ± 3 to novices, with a statistically significant difference between all of them (p < 0.05). All parameters from the scale allow discriminating between different levels of experience, with exception of the depth perception item. We conclude that the scale GEARS was able to differentiate between individuals with different levels of experience in robotic surgery and, therefore, is a validated and useful tool to evaluate surgeons in training.},

   abstract = {Purpose: We sought to develop and validate automated performance metrics to measure surgeon performance of vesicourethral anastomosis during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. Furthermore, we sought to methodically develop a standardized training tutorial for robotic vesicourethral anastomosis. Materials and Methods: We captured automated performance metrics for motion tracking and system events data, and synchronized surgical video during robotic assisted radical prostatectomy. Nonautomated performance metrics were manually annotated by video review. Automated and nonautomated performance metrics were compared between experts with 100 or more console cases and novices with fewer than 100 cases. Needle driving gestures were classified and compared. We then applied task deconstruction, cognitive task analysis and Delphi methodology to develop a standardized robotic vesicourethral anastomosis tutorial. Results: We analyzed 70 vesicourethral anastomoses with a total of 1,745 stitches. For automated performance metrics experts outperformed novices in completion time (p <0.01), EndoWrist® articulation (p <0.03), instrument movement efficiency (p <0.02) and camera manipulation (p <0.01). For nonautomated performance metrics experts had more optimal needle to needle driver positioning, fewer needle driving attempts, a more optimal needle entry angle and less tissue trauma (each p <0.01). We identified 14 common robotic needle driving gestures. Random gestures were associated with lower efficiency (p <0.01), more attempts (p <0.04) and more trauma (p <0.01). The finalized tutorial contained 66 statements and figures. Consensus among 8 expert surgeons was achieved after 2 rounds, including among 58 (88%) after round 1 and 8 (12%) after round 2. Conclusions: Automated performance metrics can distinguish surgeon expertise during vesicourethral anastomosis. The expert vesicourethral anastomosis technique was associated with more efficient movement and less tissue trauma. Standardizing robotic vesicourethral anastomosis and using a methodically developed tutorial may help improve robotic surgical training.},
